The '''Charleston Earthquake of 1886''' was a powerful intraplate earthquake that hit Charleston, South Carolina, and the East Coast of the US. After the 1812 New Madrid earthquake|1811 and 1812 earthquakes in New Madrid, Missouri, it is one of the most powerful and damaging quakes to hit the southeastern United States. The shaking occurred at about 9:50 p.m. on August 31, 1886, and lasted just under a minute. The earthquake caused severe damage in Charleston, damaging 2,000 buildings and causing between five and eight million worth in damage(over $141 million in 2009 dollars), while in the whole city the buildings were only valued at approximately $24 million. Between 60 and 110 lives were lost. Very little to no historical earthquake activity occurred in the Charleston area prior to the 1886 event, which is unusual for any seismic area.

The earthquake is estimated to have been between 6.6 and 7.3 on the Richter scale with a Mercalli Intensity Scale|Mercalli Intensity of X. Sand volcano|Sandblows were common throughout the affected area due to Earthquake liquefaction|liquefaction of the soil. Aftershocks continued to be felt for weeks after the event and minor earthquake activity that still continues in the area today may be a continuation of aftershocks.  There were at least sixty fatalities.

It was felt as far away as Boston, Massachusetts to the north, Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin to the northwest, as far west as New Orleans, Louisiana, as far south as Cuba, and as far east as Bermuda.  

The 1886 earthquake is a heavily studied example of an intraplate earthquake. The earthquake is believed to have occurred on Geologic fault|faults formed during the break-up of Pangaea. Similar faults are found all along the east coast of North America. It is thought that such ancient faults remain active from forces exerted on them by present-day motions of the North American Plate. The exact mechanisms of intraplate earthquakes are a subject of much ongoing research.

===Damage===

Within the city almost all of the buildings sustained damage and most had to be torn down and rebuilt.  Wires were cut and the railroad tracks were torn apart, cutting residents off from the outside world and vice-versa.  The damage was assessed to be between five and eight million dollars.  

Major damage occurred as far away as Tybee Island, Georgia, (more than 60 miles away) and structural damage was reported several hundred miles from Charleston (including central Alabama, central Ohio, eastern Kentucky, southern Virginia and western West Virginia). 

Earthquake bolts were added to existing unreinforced masonry buildings to add support to the structure without having to demolish the structure due to instability. The bolts pass through the existing masonry walls tying walls on opposite sides of the structure together for stability.
