The {{nihongo|'''1993 southwest-off Hokkaido earthquake'''|北海道南西冲地震|Hokkaidō Nansei Oki Jishin}} occurred at 13:17:12 coordinated universal time|UTC on {{date|12 July 1993}} in the Sea of Japan near the island of Hokkaido.

==Tectonic setting==
The earthquake occurred in the backarc region of the convergent boundary where the Pacific Plate Subduction|subducts beneath the Eurasian Plate.

==Damage==
The earthquake shaking caused moderately severe damage, VIII on the Mercalli scale. The tsunami reached Okushiri between 2 and 7 minutes after the earthquake. A tsunami warning was given 5 minutes after the earthquake by the Japanese Meteorological Agency|JMA. However, this was too late for the inhabitants of Okushiri. The quake caused fires to start in the town of Okushiri, adding greatly to the total damage.

==Characteristics==
===Earthquake===
The earthquake had two distinct shocks. The first lasted for 20 seconds, while the second lasted 35 seconds.

The rupture occurred on a fault that dipped at 24 degrees to the east. It had an estimated length of 150&nbsp;km with a displacement of 2.5 m. The island of Okushiri subsided by 5&ndash;80&nbsp;cm.

===Tsunami===
The tsunami inundated large parts of Okushiri, despite its tsunami defenses. Okushiri had been struck by another 1983 Sea of Japan earthquake|tsunami 10 year earlier. A maximum run-up of 32 m was recorded on the western part of the island near Monai. A tsunami was widely observed in the Sea of Japan with a run-up of 3.5 m at Akita Prefecture|Akita in northern Honshu, up to 4.0 m in southeastern Russia and up to 2.6 m on the coast of South Korea.

===Landslide===
The Okushiri-port landslide involved a volume of 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> m? of rock. The slide failure occurred at the base of a Volcanic rock|volcanic breccia bed (geology)|bed. The slide occurred in two phases that may match the two separate shocks recorded for the earthquake.

==Aftermath==
The destructive power of this tsunami led to an overhaul of the sea defences on Okushiri involving the construction of tsunami sluices on a river and strengthened embankments. New escape routes were also provided and help was given for households to purchase emergency broadcast receivers.
