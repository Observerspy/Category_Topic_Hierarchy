The '''1887 Yellow River flood''' was a devastating flood on the Yellow River (''Huang He'') in China. This river is prone to flooding due to the elevated nature of the river, running between dykes above the broad plains surrounding it. The flood that began in September 1887 inundated the area, killing some 900,000 people. It was one of the List of natural disasters by death toll#Ten deadliest natural disasters|deadliest natural disasters ever recorded.

==History==
For centuries, the farmers living near the Yellow River had built Dike (construction)|dikes to contain the rising waters, caused by silt accumulation on the riverbed. In 1887, this rising riverbed, coupled with days of heavy rain, overcame the dikes on around 28 September, causing a massive flood. Since there is no international unit with which to measure a flood's strength it is usually classified by the extent of the damage done, depth of water left and number of casualties.

The waters of the Yellow River are generally thought to have broken through the dikes in Huayankou, near the city of Zhengzhou in Henan province. Owing to the low-lying plains near the area, the flood spread very quickly throughout Northern China, covering an estimated {{convert|50000|sqmi|km2}}, swamping agricultural settlements and commercial centers. After the flood, two million were left homeless.
