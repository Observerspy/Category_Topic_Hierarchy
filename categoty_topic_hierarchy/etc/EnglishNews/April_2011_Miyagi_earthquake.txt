The '''April 2011 Miyagi earthquake''' (Japanese: {{Nihongo|"2011 Miyagi Prefecture Earthquake"|2011年 宫城県冲地震|2011-Nen Miyagi-ken-oki jishin}}) was a Moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.1&nbsp;M<sub>w</sub> earthquake, with an epicenter|epicentre off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture, approximately {{Convert|66|km}} east of Sendai, Japan. The earthquake was classified as an aftershock of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|March 11 Tōhoku earthquake, and occurred at 23:32&nbsp;Japan Standard Time|JST (14:32&nbsp;Coordinated Universal Time|UTC) on Thursday, 7&nbsp;April 2011.

Immediately after the earthquake, several tsunami warnings were issued for the northeastern coast of Honshu; however, they were all canceled 90&nbsp;minutes later. Over 3&nbsp;million households in the area were left without power, and several nuclear plants suffered minor inconveniences. There was no major structural damage, but the quake killed at least 4&nbsp;people and injured 141.

==Earthquake==
The Moment magnitude scale|magnitude&nbsp;7.1 (Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>W</sub>) earthquake occurred submarine earthquake|undersea at a Hypocenter|focal depth of 49&nbsp;km (30.4&nbsp;mi) in the western Pacific Ocean on 7&nbsp;April 2011 at 14:21&nbsp;UTC, approximately 66&nbsp;km (41&nbsp;mi) east of Sendai. The quake was a direct result of Thrust fault#Reverse faults|thrust&ndash;reverse faulting on or near the subduction zone Plate tectonics|plate boundary between the Pacific plate|Pacific and North American Plates. Initially estimated at a magnitude of 7.4, the tremor was felt in several areas near the east coast of Honshu as an aftershock of the 11 March magnitude&nbsp;9.0 megathrust 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake. The aftershock sequence of this event is ongoing since 11&nbsp;March, and includes over 58 earthquakes of magnitude&nbsp;6.0 or greater up until 7&nbsp;April 2011, with only two others of magnitude&nbsp;7.0 or greater. 

==Damage and casualties==
Although the quake was located several miles offshore, moderate to very strong shaking was reported as far inland as Tokyo, about 333&nbsp;km (207&nbsp;mi) from its epicentre. 

Four people were reported dead as a result of the earthquake, including an elderly woman in Yamagata Prefecture who lost power to her medical ventilator. The Nikkei 225|Nikkei index fell sharply at the closing but rebounded the next day when reports of limited damage were confirmed.
