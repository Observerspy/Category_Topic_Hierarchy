The '''1481 Rhodes earthquake''' occurred at 3:00 in the morning on 3 May. It triggered a small tsunami, which caused local flooding. There were an estimated 30,000 casualties. It was the largest of a series of earthquakes that affected Rhodes, starting on 15 March 1481, continuing until January 1482.

==Tectonic setting==
The island of Rhodes lies on part of the boundary between the Aegean Sea Plate|Aegean Sea and African Plate|African plates. The tectonic setting is complex, with a Neogene history that includes periods of Thrust tectonics|thrusting, Extensional tectonics|extension and Strike-slip tectonics|strike slip. Currently the island is undergoing a counter-clockwise rotation (17° ±5° in the last 800,000 years) associated with the south Aegean sinistral Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip fault system. The island had also been tilted to the northwest during the Pleistocene, an uplift attributed to a Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|reverse fault lying just to the east of Rhodes.

==Damage==
Sources refer to destruction in Rhodes Town; the Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes was sufficiently damaged to require immediate rebuilding (Rhodes was at the time under siege by the Turks).

==Characteristics==

===Tsunami===
The tsunami appears to have been relatively minor, estimated at a maximum 1.8 m. However, it was observed on the Levantine coasts and a tsunami deposit|tsunami sediment layer found at Dalaman, on the southwest coast of Turkey, has been dated at 1473 ±46, consistent with this event.

===Earthquake===
There was a major foreshock on 15 March of that year. Following the mainshock on 3 May, earthquakes (presumably aftershocks) continued until January 1482, with large aftershocks on 5 May, 12 May, 3 October and 18 December. The estimated magnitude for the mainshock is 7.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale.
