==Tectonic setting==
The earthquake occurred along the boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The earthquake is likely to be a result of thrust fault|thrust-faulting, caused by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate.

The coastal parts of Peru and Chile have a history of great megathrust earthquakes originating from this plate boundary, such as the 1960 Valdivia earthquake.

==Damage==
The port of Pisco, Peru|Pisco was completely destroyed by the tsunami, with at least three ships being swept over the remains of the town.

==Characteristics==

The tsunami was reported in Japan where it produced run-ups of 10s of metres.

==Economic impact==
