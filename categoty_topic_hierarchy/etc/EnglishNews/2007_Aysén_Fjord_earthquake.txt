The '''Aisén Fjord earthquakes''' were a series of seismic events of different magnitudes that occurred in Aisén Fjord from January 22, 2007, to April 22.

On the moment magnitude scale, the earthquake reached a gradation of 6.2. Ten people disappeared, according to ONEMI (Chile's National emergency office), but three bodies were found on April 22 by the Navy of Chile.

On the mountains around the fjord, the earthquake caused landslides that in turn created waves as high as 6m, which severely damaged some salmon aquaculture installations. The potable water systems of the cities of Puerto Chacabuco, Chile|Puerto Chacabuco and Puerto Aisén, Chile|Puerto Aisén were broken, forcing firefighters and the army of Chile|army to supply water. The electricity network of Puerto Chacabuco was also cut off by the temblor.

The earthquake expanded to several zones of the country. At 6:22 a.m. (local time) on April 22, an intense earthquake was felt in Santiago, reaching grade II on the Mercalli scale.

Despite the protests against the government organized by Aysen's mayor, Chile's president, Michelle Bachelet visited the affected zone.
