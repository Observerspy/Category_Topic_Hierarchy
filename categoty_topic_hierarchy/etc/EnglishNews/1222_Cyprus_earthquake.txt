The '''1222 Cyprus earthquake''' occurred at about 06:15 Coordinated Universal Time|UTC on 11 May. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.0&ndash;7.5 and triggered a tsunami that was recorded in Libya and Alexandria. The strongest shaking was felt in Nicosia, Limassol and Paphos.

The relative motion of the Anatolian Plate is almost entirely westwards relative to the African Plate.

==Damage==
