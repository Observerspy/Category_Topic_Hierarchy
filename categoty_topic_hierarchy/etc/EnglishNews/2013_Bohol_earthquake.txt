The '''2013 Bohol earthquake''' occurred on October 15, 2013, at {{Tooltip|8:12 a.m.|UTC at 12:12 a.m.}} (Philippine Standard Time|PST) in Bohol, an island province located in Central Visayas, Philippines. It affected the whole Central Visayas region, particularly Bohol and Cebu. The quake was felt in the whole Visayas area and as far as Masbate island in the north and Cotabato provinces in southern Mindanao.

According to official reports by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), 222 were reported dead, 8 were missing, and 976 people were injured. In all, more than 73,000 structures were damaged, of which more than 14,500 were totally destroyed.

It was the deadliest earthquake in the Philippines in 23 years. The energy released by the quake was equivalent to 32 Little Boy|Hiroshima bombs. Previously, Bohol was also hit by an earthquake on February 8, 1990 that damaged several buildings and caused a tsunami.

On November 7, just 3 weeks after the quake, Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) struck the region. Although the storm's eye missed the area affected by the earthquake, it sent some 40,000 Boholanos still living in temporary shelters back to evacuation centers and disrupted relief efforts in the province.

==Intensities==
File:2013BoholCebuEarthquakeIntensityMap.png|thumb|Intensity map during the Bohol Quake
The quake was felt several parts of Visayas and Mindanao. The strongest intensity was reported in Sagbayan Bohol which is the epicenter of the quake which measured Intensity 8 to 9 classified by Phvilocs as devastating. Intensity 7 to 8 was reported in Metro Cebu and Southern Cebu and the rest of Bohol. Intensity 6 over Northern Cebu and some parts of Negros Oriental. Intensity 5 over the rest of Negros Oriental and Camotes Island. Intensity 4 over Negros Occidental and Iloilo in Visayas Misamis Oriental specifically Cagayan De Oro City in Mindanao Masbate in Luzon.

==Geology==
File:7.2 Bohol, Philippines quake.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|wikt:shakemap|Shakemap of the Visayas islands, showing location and strength of quake. Star marks the epicenter (Sagbayan, Bohol).
Initially it was thought that the epicenter was {{convert|2|km}} east of Carmen, Bohol, triggered by the East Bohol Fault. This was apparent in the pattern of epicenters of the subsequent aftershocks.

On October 20, a team of state volcanologists led by Dr. Teresito Bacolcol had discovered the theorized new fault (now named North Bohol Fault) in Inabanga, Bohol|Inabanga, a town {{convert|20|km}} north of the epicenter. Vertical displacement, as much {{convert|10|ft}}, was noted in the landscape of the town. According to experts, the fault may be as much as {{convert|100|km}} long. It was also noted that Bohol gained around 500 meters more of shoreline due to the quake and shifted {{convert|55|cm}} west towards Cebu Island.

===North Bohol Fault===
File:Loon 7 earthquake.JPG|thumbnail|right|Raised sea bottom at Loon (the water used to extend to the mangroves at right)
PHIVOLCS reported that the North Bohol Fault (NBF), which generated the Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub> 7.2 earthquake, is a northeast-southwest trending reverse fault along the western sector of Bohol (island)|Bohol island. Surface ruptures ranging from {{convert|0.10|m}} to as high as {{convert|5|m}} in vertical displacements were exposed in Barangay Anonang in Inabanga, Bohol. The mapped surface of NBF is {{convert|6|km}} long from Barangay New Anonang in Buenavista, Bohol|Buenavista to Barangay Napo in Inabanga and generally trends 40 degrees northeast and dips at at 50 degrees southeast. The team continues to map its probable extension of NBF northeast of Inabanga towards Getafe and southwest towards Loon and Maribojoc.

The longest, continuous individual trace mapped by the team is approximately {{convert|2|km}} in Barangay Anonang. In this barangay, surface rupture trends 40 degrees northeast. The surface rupture manifested as prominent fault scarps, which range from {{convert|2|m}} to {{convert|5|m}} of vertical displacements. Other geomorphic manifestations observed in Barangay Anonang include {{convert|2.5|m}} vertical displacement of Cawasan Creek in Sitio Calubian, producing a small waterfall at the point where the fault transects the creek. Other typical features associated with reverse faulting, such as scallops, bulges and warps, were also observed in the deformation zone, which extended as wide as {{convert|30|m}} in some places.

===Aftershocks===
Aftershocks continue to rattle Bohol and Cebu. As of December 6, 4,026 aftershocks were recorded, 114 of which were felt. and another 4.8 magnitude quake at 1:28 p.m. on November 12, centered at San Isidro, Bohol.

==Warnings==
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a Pacific-wide tsunami threat. The United States Geological Survey issued a yellow warning, saying "some casualties and damage are possible and the impact should be relatively localised. Past yellow alerts have required a local or regional level response." SHOA, of the Chilean Navy, stated the earthquake would not affect national or South American coasts.

==Casualties and infrastructure damage==
The earthquake struck as the Philippines was observing the Islam in the Philippines|Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha. The public holiday had closed schools, some businesses, and offices which helped reduce the number of casualties.

A total of Philippine peso|?2.25 billion worth of damages to public buildings, roads, bridges, and flood controls was reported in Bohol and Cebu. A total of 671,103 families or more than 3.2 million people were affected by the quake. Out of the total number of affected, 71,822 families or more than 348 thousand people were displaced.

===Bohol===
By far the most casualties and damages occurred in Bohol. A total of 209 people were confirmed dead, 877 people were confirmed injured, and 8 confirmed missing.

Also, a total of 1,255,128 people (the province's entire population) were affected by the quake. Nearly 71,900 residential houses were damaged (out of which 14,480 were totally destroyed), with the towns of Loon, Tubigon, Bohol|Tubigon, Carmen, Bohol|Carmen, and Calape, Bohol|Calape among the worst affected.

==Effects==

===Transportation===
Several flights from Cebu and Bohol airports and the airport operations itself were put on hold as response to check the safety status of the airport buildings. Mactan International Airport in Mactan was later opened before midday;,

===Health===

Many Bohol residents were left without adequate safe drinking water and sanitary facilities after the quake. Consequently serious public health issues arose such as cases of diarrhea and water-borne diseases. Worst affected were the municipalities closest to the epicenter, such as Sagbayan, San Isidro, Calape, Tubigon, Clarin and Catigbian.

There are also other threads to public health. Community health centers and hospitals were rendered uninhabitable, resulting in makeshift wards outside. The food supply was disrupted with many markets not operating for a week after the quake. Furthermore, the prolonged period of aftershocks forced the population to reside outside in makeshift shelters, afraid to be inside weakened buildings, and causing psychological trauma.

===Power and water supply===
One in every five households in Bohol had no electrical power a week after the earthquake hit. In terms of number of barangays, according to the Department of Energy (Philippines)|Department of Energy, 91 percent of 602 villages have their power been restored.

By October 20, water supply in 42 towns of Bohol had also been restored but the towns of Calape, Cortes, Loon, Maribojoc, and Sagbayan were still out of water supply.

As a result of Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), the province of Bohol suffered renewed power outages since the province’s main source of electricity is from a power plant in Leyte, which was, along with transmission lines, damaged by the storm. Massive brownouts and blackouts lasted for several weeks, even affecting the water supply. Electrical power was restored to all municipalities by November 23.
