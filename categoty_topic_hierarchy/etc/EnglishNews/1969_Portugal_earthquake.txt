The '''1969 Portugal earthquake''' struck western Portugal and Morocco on February 28 at 02:40 Coordinated universal time|UTC. Originating west of the Strait of Gibraltar, the earthquake registered a Moment magnitude scale|magnitude of 7.8 and the maximum felt intensity was VII (Very Strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. In total, thirteen people died. Far more people sustained minor injuries.

==Tectonic setting==
{{see also|Geology of Portugal}}

The epicenter of the earthquake lies within a diffuse zone of seismicity known as the Azores-Gibraltar Transform Fault|Azores-Gibraltar seismic belt, Investigations using Multibeam echosounder|multibeam swathe bathymetry have revealed additional SW-NE trending reverse faults and fold axes and a set of WNW-ESE trending lineaments, interpreted as Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip faults. The earthquake was located within the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain where active reverse faulting has been imaged on reflection seismology|seismic reflection data.

== Damage and casualties ==
At magnitude 7.8, the earthquake was considered very powerful. The resulting damage killed thirteen people (11 in Morocco and 2 in Portugal) and injured about a further 1,000. Damage to local buildings was "moderate", according to the United States Geological Survey. Overall, structures were prepared for the earthquake and responded well, retaining slight, if any, damage.

==Characteristics==
The earthquake is interpreted to result from movement on a southeast-dipping reverse fault.
