The '''2007 Tocopilla earthquake''' occurred on November 14 at 15:40:53 UTC (12:40:53 local time). Its epicenter was located between the localities of Quillagua and Tocopilla, affecting the Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá and the Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta regions in northern Chile. The earthquake had a moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude of 7.7 Seventeen aftershocks of magnitude greater than 5.3, including one of magnitude 7.1 and two others of magnitude 6.3 or higher, were recorded. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning, stating a tsunami had been generated; after one hour, this warning was cancelled.

The earthquake was felt from Santiago, Chile|Santiago, 1,245&nbsp;km south from the epicenter, to La Paz, about 700&nbsp;km north-northeast.

== Tectonic summary ==
The United States Geological Survey|USGS reported that the earthquake resulted from the release of stresses generated by the subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate beneath the South American Plate. In this region, known as the Peru-Chile subduction zone, the Nazca Plate thrusts beneath South America at a rate of approximately 79&nbsp;mm/year in an east-north-east direction. This earthquake indicates subduction-related thrust fault|thrusting, likely on the interface between these two plates.

This earthquake occurred near (and within) the southern end of the rupture area of the 1877 Iquique earthquake|great magnitude 9.1 earthquake of 1877, which produced a destructive tsunami and whose source region has since the late 1970s been recognized as a potentially dangerous seismic gap. In 1995, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake occurred in the same subduction zone approximately 200&nbsp;km further south of the November 14th event.

==Damage and casualties==

At least two deaths have been attributed to this earthquake, one being an 88-year old woman crushed under a collapsing wall at Tocopilla, There were also reports of widespread power outages in the region, including the cities of Antofagasta, Calama, Chile|Calama and Arica, Chile|Arica. The earthquake disrupted copper mining in the region; because Chile is the world's top supplier of copper, the earthquake caused prices of the metal to jump by more than 6%. Tin prices also rose 4% to reach a record high. There were reports of several dozens of road workers trapped inside a collapsed highway tunnel.

200 homes were destroyed by the shaking and up to 15,000 people were displaced. In Tocopilla alone, 1,000 homes were demolished, representing 30% of all standing structures.
