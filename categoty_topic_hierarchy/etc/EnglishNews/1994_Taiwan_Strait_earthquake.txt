The '''1994 Taiwan Strait earthquake''' occurred on September 16, 1994 at 14:20 local time (06:20 UTC) in the southern Taiwan Strait. The magnitude of this earthquake was given as M<sub>w</sub> 6.8 by USGS and M<sub>s</sub> 7.3 by Fujian Seismological Bureau. The epicenter was located about 150 to 180&nbsp;km from the coast of the border of Guangdong and Fujian, and about 150&nbsp;km southwest of Taiwan.

== Geology ==

The earthquake occurred in the transition zone from the continental margin to the continent-ocean transitional crust. In this region, the depth of the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity|Moho interface decreases from about 28&nbsp;km in the west to about 20&nbsp;km in the east. The transition between continental and oceanic crusts is reflected in the variation of the depth of the Moho interface.

There are several NW trending faults in the Taiwan Strait, including the Ningde-Sandiaojiao fault zone (宁德-三貂角断裂带), the Taizhong-Jinjiang fault zone (台中-晋江断裂带), and the Bashi fault zone (巴士断裂带).

A paper of Fujian Seismological Bureau showed that the earthquake was caused by left-lateral strike slip of a normal fault.

The earthquake had a maximum slip of 14 m in the hypocentral region. The source duration was about 4 s, which is short for an event with magnitude about M<sub>w</sub> 6.7. From the slip amplitude and the source duration, it was suggested that this earthquake began as a breaking of a strong asperity with low dynamic friction, had high stress drop, and was stopped by large friction around the asperity.

== Damage ==

The intensities recorded in Taiwan were shindo 4 in Penghu, 3 in Kaohsiung, and 2 in Taipei. The earthquake could be felt in Hong Kong and Macau, and the intensity recorded in Hong Kong was MM V to VI. Cities as north as Hefei and as west as Nanning were included in the felt range.

== Tsunami ==

A tsunami was triggered by the earthquake. The heights of the tsunami were recorded as 38&nbsp;cm in Penghu, Taiwan and 18&nbsp;cm in Dongshan County|Dongshan, Fujian, China.
