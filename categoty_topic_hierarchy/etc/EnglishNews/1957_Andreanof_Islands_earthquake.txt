The '''1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake''' was a magnitude 8.6 moment magnitude scale|M<sub>W</sub> It was centered at {{Coord|51.5|N|175.7|W|type:event}} in the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust, south of the Andreanof Islands group of the Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska.

The earthquake caused damage to infrastructure on Adak Island and Umnak Island, as well as causing an eruption of long-dormant volcano Mount Vsevidof. It also caused a tsunami that reached a height of 16 meters (52&nbsp;ft) and caused around $5,000,000 in damage in Hawaii, destroying two villages on Oahu, and two bridges in the Aleutian region. No lives were lost in either the earthquake or the tsunami.

{{As of|2009}} it remains the fourth largest-magnitude quake in the United States.
