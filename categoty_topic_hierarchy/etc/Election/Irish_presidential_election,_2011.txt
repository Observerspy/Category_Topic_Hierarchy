The '''Irish presidential election of 2011''' was the thirteenth [[Irish presidential election|presidential election]] to be held in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the first to be contested by a record seven candidates.<ref name=seven_candidates/> It was held on Thursday, 27 October 2011.<ref name="dateset" /><ref>Voting on certain offshore islands took place on 24 and 25 October. {{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/presidential-election/voting-begins-in-presidential-election-today-2914780.html|title=Voting begins in presidential election today|date=24 October 2011|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> The election was held to elect a successor to [[Mary McAleese]], with the winner scheduled to be inaugurated as the ninth [[President of Ireland]] on 11 November 2011. [[Irish constitutional referendums, 2011|Two constitutional referendums]] and a [[Dublin West by-election, 2011|by-election]] for a vacant [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] seat in the [[Dublin West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin West constituency]] took place on the same day.<ref name=IT_26072011>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0726/breaking58.html|title=Date set for presidential poll|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=27 July 2011|first=Eoin|last=Burke-Kennedy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0907/dublinwest.html|title=Dublin West by-election set for 27 October|date=7 October 2011|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref>

The seven candidates were [[Mary Davis (activist)|Mary Davis]], [[Seán Gallagher]], [[Michael D. Higgins]], [[Martin McGuinness]], [[Gay Mitchell]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] and [[Dana Rosemary Scallon]]. Davis, Gallagher, Norris and Scallon (all running as Independents), secured their nominations via local authorities. Higgins was put forward by [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]], McGuinness was put forward by [[Sinn Féin]] and Mitchell was put forward by [[Fine Gael]]. The previously dominant [[Fianna Fáil]] party declined to put forward an official candidate following [[Irish general election, 2011|their disastrous general election campaign]] earlier that year. Norris, a civil rights campaigner credited with helping overthrow Ireland's laws criminalising [[homosexuality]], was the leading candidate for much of the race, and had more than double the support of the other declared candidates in January 2011. He withdrew in August 2011 but returned to the race the following month due to his continuing widespread popular appeal.

The opening televised debate, ''[[Tonight with Vincent Browne|Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate]]'' on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], saw moderator [[Vincent Browne]] challenge Sinn Féin candidate Martin McGuinness on the post-1974 membership of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), that McGuinness repeatedly denied, by producing eight books from under his desk that claimed otherwise. Fine Gael candidate Gay Mitchell suffered from lack of recognition by many voters, and suffered heavily for his controversial views on suicide and on Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth. Labour candidate Michael D. Higgins was pursued by his past links to the unpopular Fianna Fáil and his admission that he had smoked [[marijuana]]. Independent candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon interrupted the ''[[Prime Time]]'' debate, moderated by [[Miriam O'Callaghan]], to read out a statement condemning a "malicious" and "false" accusation that she had heard had been made against her family. Seán Gallagher, a former member of the Fianna Fáil national executive, was leading the opinion polls ahead of the final televised debate, moderated by [[Pat Kenny]] on ''[[The Frontline (Irish TV series)|The Frontline]]''. However, Gallagher's campaign came undone when he admitted live on air to collecting a €5,000 cheque for a Fianna Fáil fundraiser event from a man he described as a "convicted criminal and fuel smuggler".

Michael D. Higgins was ultimately elected the ninth President of Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1028/vote_tracker.html|title=RTÉ Live Election Count (Friday)|date=28 October 2011|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15488067|title=Irish presidential election: Michael D Higgins elected|date=31 October 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref> Gallagher finished in second place, McGuinness finished in third, while Norris, favourite for much of the race, finished fifth.

The Irish version has ‘ag a bhfuil cúig bliana tríochad slán’ (that is, has completed thirty-five years), whereas the English version is ‘who has reached his thirty-fifth year of age’, which could mean has entered rather than completed that year." As according to article 25.5.4 of ''Bunreacht na hÉireannn'' in "case of conflict... the text in the national language (Irish) shall prevail", this means a candidate must be at least 35 years old. {{cite book|title=Report of the Constitution Review Group|archivedate=21 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110721123405/http://www.constitution.ie/reports/crg.pdf|url=http://www.constitution.ie/reports/crg.pdf|date=July 1996|pages=25, 42}}</ref>

==Nomination campaign==
Following the general election in [[Irish general election, 2011|February 2011]], and the election of the [[members of the 24th Seanad]], only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: [[Fine Gael]] (76 [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] and 19 senators), the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] (37 TDs and 13 senators) and [[Fianna Fáil]] (19 TDs and 14 senators). [[Sinn Féin]], the next largest party in the [[Dáil Éireann]], have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.

===Fine Gael===
[[Gay Mitchell]], MEP for the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin constituency]] and former [[Teachta Dála|TD]] for [[Dublin South–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Dublin South–Central]] was chosen as the Fine Gael candidate at a special convention held on 9 July 2011.<ref name="mitchell">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0709/breaking24.html|title=Mitchell chosen as FG candidate|last=De Bréadún|first=Deaglán|date=9 July 2011|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0610/breaking13.html|title=Mitchell to seek FG nomination|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=10 June 2011}}</ref> He announced that he would be seeking the party's nomination in June 2011, having been contacted by "a large number of senior figures in the party".<ref name="coxtimes"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0615/1224298937952.html|title=Cox clears hurdle in bid for presidency as FG accepts him|last=McGee|first=Harry|date=15 June 2011|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="sindo12June">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/crowded-field-makes-winning-presidency-no-walk-in-park-2672712.html|title=Crowded field makes winning Presidency no walk in Park|last=Sheehan|first=Maeve|date=12 June 2011|work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref> Voting was by secret ballot, with an [[electoral college]] consisting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party (TDs, Senators and MEPs) with 70% of the vote, county and city councillors (20%) and the twelve-member executive council (10%).<ref name="itimes110611">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0611/1224298736220.html|title=FG is not parachuting candidate, says Shatter|author=Arthur Beesley & Paul Cullen|date=11 June 2011|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>

===Fianna Fáil===
For the first time in any presidential election, Fianna Fáil neither ran a candidate nor supported the nomination of a candidate. The decision was made at a meeting of the parliamentary party on 31 August 2011, and was in line with the recommendations of the six-person subcommittee formed by the party leader [[Micheál Martin]] to consider the matter.<ref name="timesff">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0901/1224303294092.html|title=Fianna Fáil decides against fielding presidential candidate|date=1 September 2011|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=1 September 2011|last=McGee |first=Harry}}</ref>
