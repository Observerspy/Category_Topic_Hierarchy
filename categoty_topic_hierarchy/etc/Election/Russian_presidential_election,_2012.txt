The '''2012 Russian presidential election''' was held on 4 March 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia's presidential elections scheduled for March 2012 |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=21&nav_id=75561 |work=[[B92]] |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> There were five officially-registered candidates: four representatives of registered parties and one independent. The election was for a new, extended term of six years.

At the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] proposed that his predecessor, [[Vladimir Putin]] stand for the Presidency in 2012; an offer which Putin accepted. Putin immediately offered Medvedev to stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December and becoming [[Prime Minister of Russia]] at the end of his presidential term.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia's Putin set to return as president in 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15045816 |newspaper=BBC News |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

All independents had to register by 15 December, and candidates nominated by parties had to register by 18 January. The final list was announced on 29 January. On 2 March, outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev addressed the nation on the national television channels about the following presidential election. He invited the citizens of Russia to vote in the election to be held on 4 March 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title='I'm Sure You'll Make Right Choice,' Medvedev Tells Nation|url=http://en.rian.ru/society/20120302/171681349.html |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref>

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}

===Prokhorov's campaign===
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Mikhail Prokhorov made a tour around the country, meeting with his supporters in various cities. He was the only candidate to do so except for Putin, who, however, visited Russia's regions as a part of his [[Prime Minister of Russia]] duties.

===Putin's campaign===
{{Wikisource|Vladimir Putin/Articles}}
In the course of the 2012 presidential campaign, in order to present his manifesto, Putin published 7 articles in different [[Media of Russia|Russian newspapers]]. In those articles, he presented his vision of the problems which Russia successfully solved in the last decade and the goals yet to be achieved. The topics of the articles were as follows: the general overview, the ethnicity issue, economic tasks, democracy and government efficiency, social policy, military, foreign policy.<ref>[http://neprussia.ru/news/maximum/1170 7 статей и джек-пот: Путин завершил серию публикаций]</ref>

====Speeches====
[[File:Moscow rally 23 February 2012, Luzhniki 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Panorama of the 23 February Luzhniki rally, where Putin made his ''Borodino'' speech]]
During the campaign Putin made a single outdoor public speech at a 100,000-strong rally of his supporters in the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] on 23 February, Russia's [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]].<ref name=rian-luzhniki>[http://en.rian.ru/video/20120223/171487865.html Putin Supporters Fill Moscow Stadium] [[RIAN]]</ref> In the speech he called not to betray the [[Mother Russia|Motherland]], but to love her, to unite around Russia and to work together for the good, to overcome the existing problems.<ref name=vz-luzhniki>[http://vz.ru/news/2012/2/23/563536.html Путин: Главное, чтобы мы были вместе] vz.ru {{ru icon}}</ref> He said that foreign interference in Russian affairs should not be allowed, that Russia has its own free will.<ref name=vz-luzhniki/> He compared the political situation at the moment (when fears were spread in the Russian society that the [[2011–13 Russian protests]] could instigate a [[color revolution]] directed from abroad) with the [[First Fatherland War]] of 1812, reminding that its 200th anniversary and the anniversary of the [[Battle of Borodino]] would be celebrated in 2012.<ref name=vz-luzhniki/> Putin cited [[Lermontov]]'s poem ''[[Borodino (poem)|Borodino]]'' and ended the speech with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]'s famous [[Great Patriotic War]] slogan "The Victory Shall Be Ours!" (''"Победа будет за нами!"'').<ref name=rian-luzhniki/><ref name=vz-luzhniki/>

The BBC reported that some attendees claimed they had been made to take part in the rally or paid. Some said they had been told they were attending a "folk festival". After Putin spoke, popular folk band [[Lubeh]] took to the stage.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17136644 ''Putin tells stadium rally 'battle' is on for Russia''], BBC, retrieved 28/2/2012</ref>

===Zhirinovsky's campaign===
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
[[Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky]] is a veteran of Russian politics who has participated in five presidential [[elections in Russia]] (every election since 1996). Zhirinovsky's campaign slogan for 2012 was "Vote Zhirinovsky, or things will get worse".<ref name=clown-showman>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16750990 Profiles of Russia's 2012 presidential election candidates] [[BBC]]</ref> [[Proshka]], an [[donkey|ass]] owned by [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], became prominent during the presidential campaign, when he was filmed in an election advertisement video. On the last episode of debates with Prokhorov, just before the elections, Zhirinovsky produced a scandal, calling those Russian celebrities which supported Prokhorov, including a pop-[[diva]] and a veteran of Russian pop  scene [[Alla Pugacheva]], "prostitutes" ("I thought you are an artful person, politician, cunning man, but you are just a clown and a psycho" replied Pugacheva. "I am what I am. And such is my charm" replied Zhirinovsky).<ref>[http://lenta.ru/news/2012/02/28/scandal/ Жириновский устроил скандал на дебатах с Пугачевой] [[Lenta.ru]]</ref>

===Zyuganov's campaign===
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
In September 2011, [[Gennady Zyuganov]] again became the CPRF's candidate for the Russian presidential election. According to Zyuganov, "a gang of folks who cannot do anything in life apart from dollars, profits and mumbling, has humiliated the country" and called for a new international alliance to "counter the aggressive policies of imperialist circles."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/russia-communists-congress-zyuganov-589-307/|title=Communists pledge to stop ‘dollar-lovers’ experiment on Russia’|publisher=RT|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

{{Russian presidential election, 2012}}
There were over 108,000,000 eligible voters and almost all 95,000 polling stations had [[webcam]]s to observe the voting process. Following criticism of the vote in the [[Russian legislative election, 2011|December elections]], 2 web cameras were dedicated to streaming the activities at each [[polling station]], at an expense of a half billion dollars,<ref>{{Cite news |author= Brooke, James; Golloher, Jessica;  Nesnera, Andre de |title= After Big Protests, Russians Vote for President |url= http://www.voanews.com/learningenglish/home/After-Big-Protests-Russians-Vote-for-President--141242183.html |publisher= [[Voice of America]] |date= 2 March 2012 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref> i.e. about $5,000 per polling station.

==Claims of electoral irregularities==
International observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) found that although all competitors had access to the media, Putin was given clear prominence.<ref name=OSCE/> Strict candidate registration requirements also limited "genuine competition".<ref name=OSCE/> According to [[Tonino Picula]], the Special Co-ordinator to lead the short-term OSCE observer mission,
<blockquote> “There were serious problems from the very start of this election. The point of elections is that the outcome should be uncertain. This was not the case in Russia. There was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt.”<ref name=OSCE/></blockquote>

The OCSE observers concluded that voting on the day of the election was assessed positively overall, but the "process deteriorated during the vote count which was assessed negatively in almost one-third of polling stations observed due to procedural irregularities."<ref name=OSCE/> The OSCE called for a thorough investigation of the electoral violations and urged citizens to actively oversee future elections in order to increase confidence.<ref name=OSCE/>

Allegations were made that Putin supporters had been driven around in coaches in order to vote for him in multiple constituencies (which is known as [[carousel voting]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17256116 | work=BBC News | title=Russian elections: Hunting the 'carousel' voters | date=5 March 2012}}</ref>
