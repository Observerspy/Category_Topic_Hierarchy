{{Politics of Iceland}}
A '''presidential election''' was held in [[Iceland]] on Saturday, 26 June 2004.

Traditionally, Icelandic presidential elections in which the incumbent president indicates a wish to obtain a new mandate are uncontested. The current [[List of Presidents of Iceland|president]], [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], was first elected in 1996 with 40.9% of the vote, in an election with an 85.9% turnout contested by four candidates. In 2000 he was re-elected without opposition. When Ólafur Ragnar announced his intention to seek another mandate in 2004, two other candidates emerged:
:[[Ástþór Magnússon]], a businessman and pacifism activist, who won 2.6% of the vote in the 1996 election and failed to obtain the necessary 1,500 supporters when he attempted to stand in the 2000 election, and
:[[Baldur Ágústsson]], who was unknown to the general public.

Unlike parliamentary elections in Iceland, presidential elections are not fought on the basis of party politics; instead, candidates attempt to use their personalities to attract supporters and appear as a living symbol of national unity.

By tradition, the presidency is an almost entirely powerless office, as the presidents almost never use the powers granted to them by the [[constitution of Iceland|constitution]], instead just exercising ''[[moral authority]]''.  Ólafur Ragnar, however, has expressed a wish to have a public discussion on the role of the head of state. Unprecedentedly in the history of the Icelandic Republic, on 2 June 2004 Ólafur Ragnar vetoed a media ownership law passed by the [[Althing]]. [[Davíð Oddsson]], who was [[List of Prime Ministers of Iceland|Prime Minister]] at the time, claimed that the veto was tainted because the president's daughter worked for [[Baugur]] Group, which had recently acquired roughly half of the country's media. There was little doubt that Ólafur Ragnar would be re-elected, but the veto controversy had an effect on the voting &ndash; the unprecedentedly high number of empty ballots (20.6% of the total) was thought to be largely a protest of the veto.
