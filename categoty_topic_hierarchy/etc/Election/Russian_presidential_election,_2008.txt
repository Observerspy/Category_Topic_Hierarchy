'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Russia]] on 2 March 2008. They resulted in the election of [[Dmitry Medvedev]] as the third [[President of Russia]]. Medvedev, whose candidacy was supported by incumbent president [[Vladimir Putin]] and five political parties ([[United Russia]], [[Fair Russia]], [[Agrarian Party of Russia|Agrarian Party]], [[Civilian Power]], [[Russian Ecological Party "The Greens"]]), received 71% of the vote, and defeated candidates from the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] and the [[Democratic Party of Russia]].<ref>[http://exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8606&IBLOCK_ID=35 Reintroducing: The Democratic Party Of Russia], [[The eXile]], June 15, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSL2949331420080130?sp=true Presidential candidate Bogdanov denies Kremlin ties], [[Reuters]], January 30, 2008.</ref>

The fairness of the election was disputed, with official monitoring groups giving conflicting reports. Some reported that the election was free and fair, while others reported that not all candidates had equal media coverage and that [[Kremlin]] opposition was treated unfairly. Monitoring groups found a number of other irregularities.<ref name=golos/> The head of the electoral commission [[Vladimir Churov]] and the European election monitoring group [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] said the results reflected the will of the people.<ref name=rt/><ref name=ri/><ref name=b/>

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) election monitoring group refused to monitor the election because of what it called "severe restrictions on its observers by the Russian government", a charge Russia vehemently rejected, calling the decision "unacceptable".<ref name=os/><ref name=n/>

Following his appointment as First Deputy Prime Minister, many political observers expected Medvedev to be nominated as Putin's successor for the 2008 presidential elections.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/01/19EAFDE9-0C0D-43BC-99A5-BBD88912B086.html Russia: President's Potential Successor Debuts At Davos].

During the pre-election debates on the [[Zvezda (TV channel)|Star TV]] on February 20, Nikolai Gotsa, a representative of Bogdanov, accused Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his party of lying to and betraying their supporters. He accused them of voting in favor of government initiatives they criticize when in public. Zhirinovsky replied fiercely, insulting Gotsa and calling him a "sick man, a [[Schizophrenia|schizoid]]", "bastard", and punched him when they went off the cameras. Bogdanov and Gotsa launched a legal issue against Zhirinovsky. On February 28, in another debate, Bogdanov claimed he had a personal talk with Zhirinovsky, and that the latter had threatened his life and demanded to withdraw the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12414064&PageNum=0 |title=Bogdanov versus Zhirinovsky, five-year prison term asked |publisher=Itar-tass.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref>

==Conduct==
{{main|Fairness of Russian presidential election, 2008}}

The [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], in its capacity as an international election standards watchdog, refused to monitor the election because of what it called severe restrictions on its observers by the Russian government.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/03/03/russia.election/index.html Vote rig claim after Putin ally landslide - CNN.com]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> After weeks of negotiations, Russia agreed to increase the observer numbers for the ODIHR mission and extend the time frame for its visit, but the ODIHR claimed that the offer still didn't meet their requirements, insisting that it needed to send at least 50 of its observers to Russia on February 15, five days before the date proposed by Moscow, in order effectively monitor the election campaign.<ref name="os"/>

Russia responded by insisting that it was complying fully with its international obligations and that its invitation for 400 monitors meets international standards. It accused the OSCE of attempting to politicize the dispute and that it suspected ODIHR's intention from the outset was to boycott the election, saying that the ODIHR had displayed "contempt for basic ethical norms ... which, it seems, indicates that ODIHR from the start was not even trying to agree on mutually acceptable conditions for monitoring."<ref name=n>[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/world/story.html?id=292473 Election watchdog scraps plans to monitor Russian vote] [[National Post]] Retrieved on March 19, 2008</ref> 

Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] stated that {{cquote|The Russian side consented to 25 observers arriving this week and the rest of them on February, 25. Our proposal was denied.

Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mikhail Kamynin, said "The ODIHR flatly rejected a compromise without providing any clear explanations for its position. We believe such actions are unacceptable." Kamynin added that Moscow "deeply regretted" the OSCE refusal, accusing the organization, which he said generally sends 10-20 experts to observe election campaigns one or two weeks ahead of polls, of political bias against Russia.<ref name=os>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080207/98680172.html Wrap: OSCE election watchdog to boycott Russian polls - tensions rise], [[RIA Novosti]], February 7, 2008</ref>

An incident arose during the election when three out of nine members of the [[Biysk]] Electoral Commission refused to sign the protocols citing widespread falsifications in their ''Priobsky Division''. The rest of commission decided to approve the protocols as the alleged abuse was not reported during the election.<ref>[http://www.fedpress.ru/federal/polit/vibori/id_89970.html Voices of outrage in a Biysk territorial election commission]{{ru icon}}, ''FederalPress'' March 5, 2008</ref>

Representatives from the [[GOLOS Association|GOLOS]] monitoring group stated that "the Election Day was held in a relatively quiet atmosphere in contrast to the [[Russian legislative election, 2007|State Duma election day]]. Such large-scale violations observed then as campaigning next to polling stations, transporting of voters, intimidation of voters and others were practically non-existent."

An observing group from [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] stated that the result of the election was a "reflection of the will of an electorate whose democratic potential was, unfortunately, not tapped". They said "In the elections, which had more the character of a plebiscite on the last eight years in this country, the people of Russia voted for the stability and continuity associated with the incumbent President and the candidate promoted by him.

''[[The Economist]]'' reported that Medvedev has been mentioned over six times more often than his three rivals in 1,000 different news sources, according to figures from SCAN, a media database owned by Interfax, but stated that this could be due to Medvedev's high profile job as chairman of the state-owned gas monopoly, [[Gazprom]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7933596&story_id=10757103 No contest] The economist [Feb 28th 2008]</ref>

===Reactions===
According to [[Russia Today]], many in the Western media portrayed Russia's presidential election as nothing but a farce. It reported that the claims of rigging the election were not supported by the various international election monitoring organizations in attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Slovakia_Parliament.htm |title=Slovakia Parliament |publisher=Guide2womenleaders.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2010}}

Political analyst and [[United Russia]] member, [[Sergey Alexandrovich Markov|Sergei Markov]], said that the outcome of this poll was predetermined because of how much support the Russian people show for Vladimir Putin's policies. "The Russian people have seen how successful these policies have been, and they want them to continue", he says. Markov cited fears that the West would interfere and change the course of the election, like they did in [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7263293.stm#markov Viewpoints: Russian presidential election] [[BBC]] Retrieved on March 12, 2008</ref>
