====Escalation of pro-Russian unrest====
In the [[Donbass]] region of the [[Eastern Ukraine]], [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine|pro-Russian protests]] escalated into an armed separatist insurgency early in April 2014, when masked gunmen took control of several of the region's government buildings and towns.<ref name="Ukraine crisis timeline BBC"/><ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/04/30/ukraine-crisis-horlivka-idINKBN0DG0FY20140430 Masked gunmen tighten grip on eastern Ukraine], [[Reuters]] (30 April 2014)</ref>

On 15 April 2014, Ukrainian media reported that the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] had launched criminal proceedings against then-candidate [[Oleh Tsarov]] for allegedly aiding separatists and thus violating Ukraine's territorial integrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/908090-prokuratura-otkryila-ugolovnoe-proizvodstvo-protiv-tsareva-za-separatistskie-idei.html |title=Прокуратура открыла уголовное производство против Царева за сепаратистские идеи : Новости УНИАН |publisher=Unian.net |date=15 April 2014}}</ref> Tsarov withdrew his candidacy on 29 April.<ref name=TsarovOUT/>

[[Serhiy Taruta]], governor of Donetsk, has suggested a referendum, to be held on 15 June, at the same time as the potential second round of the election. The referendum would address the decentralization of political power, potentially giving regions a greater say in their own affairs, such as greater control over the taxes they levy and the power to make Russian a second official language.<ref name=wp/>

On 16 May 2014, the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] ruled that the candidate elected as a result of the presidential election would serve a full five-year term of office.<ref name="New Ukrainian president 5-year term"/>

===Russian reaction===
Initially Russia opposed rescheduling the election because the Russian government considered the removal of then President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] illegal and his temporary successors an "illegitimate [[Military junta|junta]]".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/world/europe/ukraine.html?_r=0 As Ukrainian Election Looms, Western Powers and Russia Campaign for Influence], [[New York Times]] (6 May 2014)</ref> But on 7 May 2014 [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] stated the election would be a step "in the right direction" but that the vote would decide nothing unless the rights of "all citizens" were protected.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27314816 Ukraine crisis: Russia's Putin 'backs 25 May election'], [[BBC News]] (7 May 2014)</ref> At the [[St. Petersburg International Economic Forum]] on 23 May 2014, Putin appeared to further move away from Russia's initial position by announcing that Russia would respect the outcome of the elections in Ukraine and was ready to work with whoever won the presidency.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27542057 Russia's Vladimir Putin 'to respect' Ukraine vote], [[BBC News]] (23 May)</ref>

The US and [[European Union]] vowed early May 2014 that they would impose further [[List of individuals sanctioned during the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine|sanctions against Russia]] (sanctions have been in place against Russia since the [[2014 Crimean crisis]]<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26613567 Ukraine crisis: EU and US impose sanctions over Crimea], [[BBC News]] (17 March 2014)</ref>) if it disrupted the election.

==Opinion polls==

===First round===

Poll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the two leading candidates respective colours. In the instance that there is a tie, then no figure is bolded. If no candidate obtains an absolute majority in the first round, then the two highest polling candidates will contest a [[Two-round system|run-off]] second ballot.<ref name=BBCESR/> The lead column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the two candidates with the highest figures. Poll results use the date the survey's fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. However, if such date is unknown, the date of publication will be given instead.
