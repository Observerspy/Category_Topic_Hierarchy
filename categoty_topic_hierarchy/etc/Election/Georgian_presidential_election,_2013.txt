==Background==
The [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|previous presidential elections]] were held on 5 January 2008 in a polarised political environment following the [[2007 Georgian demonstrations|November 2007 crisis]], in response to which President Mikheil Saakashvili, then serving his first term in office, brought forward the elections from the original date in autumn 2008. Saakashvili won the election with 53.47% of the votes in an election described in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) election observation mission report as "the first genuinely competitive post-independence presidential election", which "was in essence consistent with most OSCE and Council of Europe commitments and standards for democratic elections". At the same time, the mission "revealed significant challenges which need to be addressed urgently."<ref name="OSCE">[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/georgia/66641 Georgia. Extraordinary Presidential Election, 5 January 2008]. OSCE/[[ODIHR]] Election Observation Mission Final Report (4 March 2008). Retrieved on 27 November 2011.</ref>

In the October 2012 [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary elections]], the former ruling party [[United National Movement]] (ENM) lost power to the [[Georgian Dream]] coalition led by [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]], who became the new Prime Minister.

Upon the inauguration of a new president in 2013, a series of [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|constitutional]] amendments passed in the [[Parliament of Georgia]] from 2010 to 2013 will enter into force. The amendments envisage significant reduction of the president's powers in favour of the [[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]].<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22757 Key Points of Newly Adopted Constitution]. Civil Georgia. 15 October 2010.</ref>

==Candidates==
The Georgian Dream coalition named [[Giorgi Margvelashvili]], minister of education and science and deputy prime minister, as their presidential candidate on 11 May.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/11/us-georgia-presidency-idUSBRE94A0CE20130511 Georgian PM names pro-Western ally presidential candidate]. [[Reuters]]. 11 May 2013.</ref>

The candidates for the ENM presidential primaries, announced in June 2013, were former parliamentary speaker [[David Bakradze]], veteran lawmaker and former cabinet minister [[Giorgi Baramidze]], [[Shota Malashkhia]] and [[Zurab Japaridze]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Candidates for UNM Presidential Primaries Named|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26224|accessdate=11 October 2013|newspaper=Civil Georgia|date=29 June 2013}}</ref> All the primaries were won by Bakradze who was announced the presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bakradze Becomes UNM Presidential Candidate|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26312|accessdate=11 October 2013|newspaper=Civil Georgia|date=13 July 2013}}</ref>

On 12 June, [[Nino Burjanadze]] announced that she would run for president as the nominee of [[Democratic Movement – United Georgia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Burjanadze Runs for President|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26172|accessdate=11 October 2013|newspaper=[[Civil Georgia]]|date=13 June 2013}}</ref>

In total, 23 candidates contested the election.<ref name=CECresults>{{cite web|title=October 27, 2013 Presidential Elections of Georgia|url=http://www.results.cec.gov.ge/eng/|work=Election Administration of Georgia|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref>

==Opinion polls==
Opinion polls in the run-up to the election showed Margvelashvili to be the frontrunner. Polls varied between showing over 50% support for Margvelashvili and figures indicating the election would go to a second round.<ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26493 Poll: GD's Margvelashvili Leads, Followed by UNM's Bakradze].
