The '''United States presidential election of 2008''' was the 56th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee Senator [[Barack Obama]] and running mate Senator [[Joe Biden]] defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee Senator [[John McCain]] and running mate Governor [[Sarah Palin]].

McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, but the Democratic nomination was marked by a sharp contest between Obama and initial frontrunner Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], with Obama not securing the nomination until early June. Early campaigning had focused heavily on the [[Iraq War]] and the unpopularity of outgoing Republican [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], but all candidates focused on domestic concerns as well, which grew more prominent as the economy experienced the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|major financial crisis that peaked in September 2008]].

Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain, winning both the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin#Table of election results|popular vote]] and the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]], with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173; he received the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat [[United States presidential election, 1964|in nearly a half-century]]. Obama's successes in obtaining a major party's nomination and winning the general election were both firsts for an [[African American]]. Although Hillary Clinton did not win the Democratic nomination, she was the first woman to win a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection when she won the primary in New Hampshire on January 8.<ref>http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/resources/Firsts.php</ref><ref>http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/elections/preswatch_clinton.php</ref> (Shirley Chisholm's prior "win" in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to [[George McGovern]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F0061EF83959107B93C5A9178DD85F468785F9 | title=Dakotan Beats Humphrey By a Big Margin in Jersey | first=Ronald | last=Sullivan | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 7, 1972 | page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19720515&id=UmlPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7133,1487123 | title=Sanford Is Withdrawing From N.J. | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=The Times-News | location=Hendersonville, North Carolina | date=May 13, 1972 | page=12}}</ref>) She also was the first woman to be an American presidential candidate in every primary and caucus in every state.<ref>http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/resources/Firsts.php</ref>

==Background==
In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] won [[United States presidential election, 2004|reelection]], defeating the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]]. After Republican pickups in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2004|House]] and [[United States Senate elections, 2004|Senate]] in the 2004 elections, Republicans maintained control of the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.

Bush's approval ratings had been slowly declining from their high point of almost 90% after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Benedetto|first=Richard|author2=Page, Susan |title=Bush's job approval lowest since 9/11|work=USA Today|date=January 13, 2003|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2003-01-13-bush-poll_x.htm}}</ref> and they were barely 50% by his reelection. Although Bush was reelected with a larger Electoral College margin than in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], during his second term, Bush's approval rating dropped more quickly, with the [[Iraq War]] and the federal response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 being most detrimental to the public's perception of his job performance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Katrina Response Hurts Bush Most|publisher=Political Wire|date=February 17, 2006|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2006/02/17/katrina_response_hurts_bush_most.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071117202556/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2006/02/17/katrina_response_hurts_bush_most.html|archivedate=November 17, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gonyea|first=Don|title=Katrina Aftermath, Iraq Lower Support Ratings for Bush|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4860458|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=September 23, 2005|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref>

By September 2006, Bush's approval rating was below 40%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm|title=Historical Bush Approval Ratings|publisher=Hist.umn.edu|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> and in the November  [[United States elections, 2006|United States Congressional elections 2006]], Democrats gained the majority in both houses.

==Nominations==
In the United States, there are two major [[political party|political parties]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. There are also several minor parties, usually called third parties, though most media and public focus is on the two major parties.

Each [[major party]] hosts candidates who go through a nomination process to determine the [[presidential nominee]] for that party. The nomination process consists of [[United States presidential primary|primaries]] and caucuses, held by the 50 states, as well as [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. The winner of each of these primary elections usually receives delegates proportional to the percentage of the popular vote that candidate received in each states. In many Republican primaries, all the state's delegates are awarded to the winning candidate. In the Democratic Party, high-ranking party members known as [[superdelegate]]s each receive one vote in the convention. Whichever candidate has the majority of the delegates at the end of the primary elections is designated the [[presumptive nominee]] until he or she is formally nominated and endorsed for the presidency by his or her political party. This is done by the aforementioned delegates for each party.

====Before the primaries====
Media speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]] became known. In the [[United States midterm election, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Kuhnhenn |first=Jim |title=Democrats win control of Congress |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110900147.html|publisher=Washington Post |agency=AP |date=November 9, 2006 |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref> Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] as the most popular potential Democratic candidates.<ref name="guardian-2006">{{cite news|last=Borger|first=Julian|title=Now the real race begins...|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/nov/11/midterms2006.usa2|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 11, 2006|accessdate=June 7, 2009|location=London}}</ref> Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including [[Al Gore]], the runner-up in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]]; [[John Kerry]], the runner-up in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]; [[John Edwards]], his [[running mate]]; Delaware Senator Joseph Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh.<ref name="CSM">{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=John|title=With midterms over, all eyes turn to the 2008 presidential race|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1115/p09s01-cojh.html?s=widep|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=November 15, 2006|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref>

"Front-runner" status is dependent on the news agency reporting, and by October 2007, the consensus listed the three aforementioned candidates as leading the pack after several debate performances. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' listed Clinton, Edwards and Obama as the front runners, "leading in polls and fundraising and well ahead of the other major candidates".<ref>

====Early primaries/caucuses====
The early primaries and caucuses are considered the most critical of nomination process. Most candidates lacking support drop out after doing poorly in the [[Iowa caucuses]] and [[New Hampshire primary]], and these states' results often shift national preferences, according to historical polling data.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Jeffrey|title=Iowa, New Hampshire Results Often Shift National Preferences|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/103537/Iowa-New-Hampshire-Results-Often-Shift-National-Preferences.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|date=January 3, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> The states that hold early primaries and caucuses are, chronologically, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. In 2008, Florida and Michigan moved their primaries into January against the Democratic Party's rules, and the results of these primaries were discounted and disputed until after the rest of the contests occurred.<ref>{{cite news|title=Florida, Michigan Primary Do-Overs?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/politics/main3912975.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=March 6, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

At the start of the year, support for Barack Obama began rising in the polls, passing Clinton for first place in Iowa; Obama ended up winning the Iowa caucus, with John Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third.<ref name=Iowa>{{cite news|author=Crowley, Candy|author2=Malveaux, Suzanne|author3=Yellin, Jessica|title=Obama wins Iowa as candidate for change|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/03/iowa.dems/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=January 4, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> Obama's win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and [[Independent (voter)|Independents]] and showed voters viewed him as the candidate of change.<ref name=Iowa/> Iowa is viewed as the state that jump-started Obama's campaign and set him on track to win the nomination and the presidency.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinhauser|first=Paul|title=Back to where it began: Obama visits Iowa|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/22/obama.iowa/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=April 22, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> After the Iowa caucus, [[Joe Biden]] and [[Christopher Dodd]] withdrew from the nomination contest.<ref name=Iowa/>

Obama became the new front runner in New Hampshire when his poll numbers skyrocketed after his victory in Iowa.<ref name="New Hampshire polls"/> The Clinton campaign was struggling after a bad loss in Iowa and no strategy beyond the early primaries and caucuses.

On March 4, Hillary Clinton carried [[Ohio Democratic primary, 2008|Ohio]] and [[Rhode Island Democratic primary, 2008|Rhode Island]] in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a surprise upset,<ref>{{cite news|title=Clinton comeback: Fight goes on|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=March 5, 2008|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004261471_elexdems05.html|accessdate=March 5, 2008}}</ref> although she led in the polling averages in both states.<ref name="fivethirtyeight1"/><ref name=SuperTuesdayIIresults>{{cite news|title=Clinton wins key primaries, CNN projects; McCain clinches nod|work=[[CNN]]|date=March 5, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/04/march.4.contests/|accessdate=March 5, 2008}}</ref> She also carried the [[Texas Democratic primary and caucuses, 2008|primary in Texas]], but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton.<ref>{{cite news|first=|last=|author=|title=Election Center 2008 Primaries and Caucuses: Results: Democratic Scorecard|date=August 20, 2008|publisher=|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/scorecard/#D|work=[[CNN]]|pages=|accessdate=}}</ref>

Only one state held a primary in April. This was [[Pennsylvania Democratic primary, 2008|Pennsylvania]], on April 22.

Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a closed primary, which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of [[NPR]], "The established Democratic electorate was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than in most of the primaries to date."<ref>{{cite web|last=Elving|first=Ron|title=Analysis: Clinton Needed Pennsylvania to Carry On|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89865397|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=April 23, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination.

====Indiana and North Carolina====
On May 6, [[North Carolina Democratic primary, 2008|North Carolina]] and [[Indiana Democratic primary, 2008|Indiana]] held their Democratic presidential primaries. Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place. The candidates acknowledged the importance of these primaries and said they were turning point states that could make or break either of their campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schaper|first=David|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89967099|title=Looking Ahead to Indiana and N.

====Florida and Michigan====
During late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states' moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention. The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules. The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008. Initially, the Democratic leadership said it would strip all delegates from [[Florida]] and [[Michigan]], which had moved their primaries into January. In addition, all major Democratic candidates agreed officially not to campaign in Florida or Michigan, and Edwards and Obama removed their names from the Michigan ballot. Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hertzberg, Hendrik|date=June 2, 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/06/02/080602taco_talk_hertzberg|title=Memory Lapse|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

Political columnist Christopher Weber noted that while her action was self-serving, it was also pragmatic to forestall Florida or Michigan voters becoming so disaffected they did not vote for Democrats in the general election.<ref>{{cite news|author=Weber, Christopher|date=May 25, 2008|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2008/05/25/why-hillary-continues-to-run-by-hillary/12|title='Why Hillary Continues To Run' by Hillary|publisher=Politics Daily|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref> There was some speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. On May 31, 2008, the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party reached a compromise on the Florida and Michigan delegate situation. The committee decided to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the convention in August, but to only award each a half-vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://us.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/31/dems.delegates/index.html|title=Florida, Michigan get all delegates, but each gets half vote|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=May 31, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080602222431/http://us.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/31/dems.delegates/index.html|archivedate=June 2, 2008}}</ref>

====Clinching the nomination====
Technically the nomination process for major political parties continues through June of election year. In previous cycles the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the March primaries. In this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month-long campaign against Hillary Clinton. Obama had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states. Because a form of [[proportional representation]] and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1991/ii911010.html|title=The 1992 primary: proportional representation for Illinois Democrats|first=John S.|last=Jackson|author2=Barbara Leavitt Brown |work=Illinois Issues|date=October 12, 1991|accessdate=May 18, 2008|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Springfield]]}}</ref> By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the [[Associated Press]] found her numbers accurate only in one close scenario.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-05-15-495396467_x.htm|title=Fact check: Clinton vote claims under scrutiny|publisher=[[USA Today]]|agency=Associated Press|date=May 15, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

In June, after the last of the primaries had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24944453/|title=Obama claims Democratic nomination—Decision '08- msnbc.com|publisher=Msnbc.msn.com|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zeleny|first=Jeff|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/us/politics/04elect.html|title=Obama Clinches Nomination; First Black Candidate to Lead a Major Party Ticket|work=The New York Times|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/10797.html|title=Historic night: Obama clinches nomination—Bill Nichols and Ben Smith|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7.

===Republican Party nomination===
{{Main|Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Republican National Convention}}

Not only was the 2008 election the first time since [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] that neither the [[incumbent]] president nor the incumbent vice president was a candidate in the general election, but it was also the first time since the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 election]] that neither sought his party's nomination for president; as Bush was term-limited from seeking another nomination, the unique aspect was Vice President Cheney's decision not to seek the Republican nomination.<ref name="harnden2007">{{cite news|first=Toby|last=Harnden|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1435447/The-top-US-conservatives-and-liberals.html|title=The top US conservatives and liberals|accessdate=September 7, 2008|date=November 13, 2007|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London}}</ref><ref name="artandhistory1925">[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Charles_Dawes.htm Charles G.

With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates for moving their primaries into January 2008 against party rules, the race for the nomination was based there.

====Super Tuesday====
McCain was also endorsed in February by [[California]] Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] before the [[California Republican primary, 2008|California primary]] took place on Super Tuesday. This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/31/mccain.endorsements/index.html|title=Schwarzenegger backs McCain for president|publisher=CNN|date=January 31, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states. On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates. He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes. McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates.<ref name="independent">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Wesley|title=Super Tuesday results state by state|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/super-tuesday-results-state-by-state-778654.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2009|location=London}}</ref> Huckabee was the "surprise performer", winning 5 states and 218 delegates.<ref name="independent"/> Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates.<ref name="independent"/> Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would "forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win".<ref>{{cite news|title=Romney suspends presidential campaign|work=CNN|date=February 7, 2008|first=John|last=King|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/07/romney.campaign/index.html}}</ref> His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses.

Louisiana, Washington, [[Kansas Republican caucuses, 2008|Kansas]], [[Wisconsin Republican primary, 2008|Wisconsin]], and [[Washington Republican primary, 2008|Washington]] held primaries in February after Super Tuesday. Despite McCain picking up big victories, Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas.

After Super Tuesday, John McCain had become the clear front runner, but by the end of February, he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination. In March, John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, [[Texas Republican primary, 2008|Texas]], [[Ohio Republican primary, 2008|Ohio]], [[Vermont Republican primary, 2008|Vermont]], and [[Rhode Island Republican primary, 2008|Rhode Island]], putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination.<ref name=SuperTuesdayIIresults/> Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Huckabee bows to 'inevitable,' ends GOP run|work=[[CNN]]|date=March 5, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/05/huckabee/|accessdate=March 5, 2008}}</ref>

===Other nominations===
{{Main|United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 2008}}
Along with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. These were the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]], and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].

The Green Party nominated former Democratic Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]] of Georgia for President, and political activist [[Rosa Clemente]] from New York for Vice President.

The Libertarian Party nominated former Republican Congressman [[Bob Barr]] of Georgia for President, and his former rival for the Libertarian nomination [[Wayne Allyn Root]] of Nevada, for Vice President.

===Issues===

====Iraq====
The unpopular [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] was a key issue during the campaign before the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|economic crisis]]. John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it. (Obama's early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after [[World War II]],<ref name="Dallas Morning News">{{cite news|title=A Hundred Years' War?|author=[[Hendrik Hertzberg]]|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 4, 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2008/01/a-hundred-years.html}}; video at {{cite web|title=Make It 100|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf7HYoh9YMM|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly. Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.

John McCain's support for the troop 'surge' employed by General [[David Petraeus]], which was one of several factors credited with improving the security situation in Iraq, may have boosted McCain's stance on the issue in voters' minds. McCain (who supported the invasion) argued that his support for the successful surge showed his superior judgment. However, Obama was quick to remind voters that there would have been no need for a "surge" had there been no war at all, thus questioning McCain's judgment.

====Bush's unpopularity====
George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that about 30 percent of the American public approved of his job performance.<ref name="gallup.com"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Steinhauser|first=Paul|title=Poll: Bush's popularity hits new low|publisher=CNN|date=March 19, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/19/bush.poll/|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Confidence sinks to lowest since 2002 as fear tightens its hold on US consumers|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=April 11, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/04/11/business/NA-FIN-ECO-US-Consumer-Confidence.php|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref> In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush says he wants McCain to win presidency|publisher=CNN|date=March 5, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/05/mccain.bush/index.html|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref> but Bush did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Gustav]]. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/08/AR2008020800964_pf.html|title=History and Necessity Unite Bush, McCain|publisher=Washingtonpost.com|date=February 9, 2008|accessdate=January 30, 2009|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|first2=Michael|last2=Abramowitz}}</ref>

====Change vs. experience====
Before the Democratic primaries began, the dichotomy of change versus experience had already become a common theme in the presidential campaign, with Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] positioning herself as the candidate with experience and Obama embracing the characterization as the candidate most able to bring change to Washington. Before the official launch of her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]], aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the 'change' candidate, as strategist [[Mark Penn]] made clear in an October 2006 memo titled "The Plan."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/a/green-penn-10-06.mhtml |title="The Plan," October 2006 |publisher=The Atlantic |date=August 11, 2008}}</ref> In his presidential run announcement, Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that "Washington must change."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=23835|title=Obama officially announces run for the White House|work=Chicago Business News|accessdate=January 29, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090220201332/http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=23835 |archivedate=February 20, 2009}}.

By a margin of about 2-1, Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/05/super.issues/index.html |title=Keys to victory on Super Tuesday |publisher=CNN.com |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3.

John McCain quickly adopted similar campaign themes against Obama at the start of the general election campaign. Polls regularly found the general electorate as a whole divided more evenly between 'change' and 'experience' as candidate qualities than the Democratic primary electorate, which split in favor of 'change' by a nearly 2-1 margin.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Perry Bacon |author2=Jennifer Agiesta |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/09/change_vs_experience_all_over.html |title=Change vs. Experience All Over Again |work=The Washington Post |date=June 9, 2008}}</ref> Advantages for McCain and Obama on experience and the ability to bring change, respectively, remained steady through the November 4 election. However, final pre-election polling found that voters considered Obama's inexperience less of an impediment than McCain's association with sitting President George W. Bush,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x2882.xml?ReleaseID=1225 |title=Obama Ends Campaign Ahead In Ohio And Pennsylvania, Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll Finds |publisher=Quinnipiac University Polling Institute}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> an association which was rhetorically framed by the Obama campaign throughout the election season as "more of the same".

McCain appeared to undercut his line of attack by picking first-term Alaska governor [[Sarah Palin]] to be his running mate.<ref>{{cite web |author=James Joyner |url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/sarah_palin_-_john_mccains_vp_choice/ |title=Sarah Palin – John McCain's VP Choice |publisher=Outsidethebeltway.com |date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 30, 2009}}</ref> Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before that had been a council member and mayor of [[Wasilla]]. Nonetheless, she excited much of the conservative base of the GOP with her speech at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], a group that was initially lukewarm toward McCain's candidacy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23137096/ |title=Christian evangelicals send McCain a message |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC News |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 30, 2009}}</ref> However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be Vice President or President.<ref>{{cite news |title=Palin gets media savaging after faltering interview |publisher=AFP |date=September 26, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i7lJ7uGNOkOTK964WwjybvKVDouA |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> Because of Palin's conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/3205619/Sarah-Palin-seen-as-beacon-of-hope-as-defeat-at-poll-looms.html |title=Sarah Palin seen as beacon of hope as defeat at poll looms |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081017230402/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/3205619/Sarah-Palin-seen-as-beacon-of-hope-as-defeat-at-poll-looms.html |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>

====Economy====
Polls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/109759/Gallups-Quick-Read-Election.aspx|title=Gallup's Quick Read on the Election|publisher=Gallup.com|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/exit.polls/|title=Exit polls: Obama wins big among young, minority voters|publisher=CNN.com|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}</ref> In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=058cc3ea-a0f8-4a8c-b767-8cd58f359c82|title=Investors Bail Out: The D word going cheap|publisher=www.nationalpost.com|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=September 16, 2008|last=|first=}}</ref> During this period, John McCain's election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.

This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers bankruptcy]], at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that "the fundamentals of our economy are strong," despite what he described as "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street."<ref>{{cite news|last=Aigner-Treworgy|first=Adam|title=McCain: Economy still 'strong'|publisher=MSNBC|date=September 15, 2008|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/15/1399191.aspx|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> With the perception among voters to the contrary, the comment appeared to cost McCain politically.

On September 24, 2008, after the onset of the [[Global financial crisis of 2008|2008 financial crisis]], McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington to help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obama, McCain Meet In Mississippi|publisher=WAPT.com|date=December 29, 2008|url=http://www.wapt.com/news/18376597/detail.html|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate [[Joe Biden]], and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary Clinton would as well).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00213 |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes: 110th Congress, 2nd Session |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref>

All the aforementioned remarks and campaign issues hurt McCain's standing with voters. All these also occurred after the economic crisis and after McCain's poll numbers had started to fall. Although sound bites of all of these "missteps" were played repeatedly on national television, many pundits and analysts say that the actual financial crisis and economic conditions caused McCain's large drop in support in mid-September and severely damaged his campaign.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schnur|first=Dan|title=What caused McCain's poll numbers to fall?|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/investing/la-oew-schnur-cain3-2008nov03,0,6970010.story|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 3, 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Nichols|first=Hans|title=McCain May Have Last Chance to Overcome Economy in Final Debate|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aRnqc1XoUZFU&refer=home|publisher=Bloomberg|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref>

====Health care====
[[John McCain]]'s proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer.  To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a "Guaranteed Access Plan".<ref>Robert E. Moffit and Nina Owcharenko, [http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/upload/bg_2198.pdf "The McCain Health Care Plan: More Power to Families,"] The [[Heritage Foundation]], October 15, 2008</ref>

[[Barack Obama]] called for [[universal health care]].  His health care plan proposed creating a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option.  Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. It would have required parents to cover their children, but did not require adults to buy insurance.

''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported that the two plans had different philosophical focuses.  They described the purpose of the McCain plan as to "make insurance more affordable," while the purpose of the Obama plan was for "more people to have health insurance."<ref>Stacey Burling, [http://www.philly.com/inquirer/health_science/daily/20080928_Rivals__prescriptions_for_an_ailing_system.html "Rivals' prescriptions for an ailing system,"] [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]], September 28, 2008</ref>  ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'' characterized the plans similarly.<ref>Tony Leys, [http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080929/NEWS09/809290326/-1/NEWS04 "Health plans pit low-cost vs. public coverage,"] [[The Des Moines Register]], September 29, 2008</ref>  [[Commonwealth Fund|The Commonwealth Fund]] concluded that, compared with McCain's approach, Obama's plan could provide more people with affordable health insurance that covers essential services, achieve greater equity in access to care, realize efficiencies and cost savings in the provision of coverage and delivery of care, and redirect incentives to improve quality.<ref>[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=707948 The 2008 Presidential Candidates' Health Reform Proposals: Choices For America] The Commonwealth Fund</ref>

Critics of McCain's plan argued that it would not significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans, would increase costs, reduce consumer protections and lead to less generous benefit packages.<ref name="Buchmueller et al 2008">Thomas Buchmueller, Sherry A. Glied, Anne Royalty, and Katherine Swartz, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/hlthaff.27.6.w472v1 "Cost And Coverage Implications Of The McCain Plan To Restructure Health Insurance,"] ''[[Health Affairs]]'', September 16, 2008</ref>  Critics of Obama's plan argued that it would increase federal regulation of private health insurance without addressing the underlying incentives behind rising health care spending.<ref name="Antos et al 2008">Joseph Antos, Gail Wilensky, and Hanns Kuttner, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/hlthaff.27.6.w462v1 "The Obama Plan: More Regulation, Unsustainable Spending,"] ''[[Health Affairs]]'', September 16, 2008</ref><ref>Robert E.

Various analyses of the two candidates' plans came to widely varying predictions of their costs and effects. A comparison by The Tax Policy Center, a project of the [[Brookings Institution]] and the [[Urban Institute]] estimated that Obama's proposals could cost $1.6 trillion over 10 years, while the tax-related provisions of McCain's proposals could cost $1.3 trillion over the same period. A comparison by The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of [[UnitedHealth Group]], published in October 2008, found that the McCain plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 21.1 million and cost $2.05 trillion over 10 years, while the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 26.6 million and increase federal spending by $1.17 trillion over the same period.<ref>John Sheils and Randall Haught, [http://www.lewin.com/~/media/Lewin/Site_Sections/Publications/TheLewinGroupMcCain-ObamaHealthReformAnalysisRev10-15-08.pdf "McCain and Obama Health Care Policies: Cost and Coverage Compared"], The Lewin Group, October 8, 2008</ref>  Estimates prepared by HSI Networks found that the McCain plan would reduce the uninsured by 27.5 million at an annual cost of $287 billion,<ref>Roger Feldman, Lisa Tomai and Sally Duran, [http://www.hsinetwork.com/McCain_HSI-Assess_10-08-2008.pdf "Impact of John McCain 2008 Health Reform Proposal,"] HSI Network, LLC, October 8, 2008</ref> and the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 25.5 million at an annual cost of $452 billion.<ref>Roger Feldman, Lisa Tomai and Sally Duran, [http://www.hsinetwork.com/Obama_HSI-Assess_08-21-2008.pdf "Impact of Barack Obama 2008 Health Reform Proposal,"] HSI Network, LLC, October 8, 2008</ref>

A poll released in early November 2008, found that voters supporting Obama listed health care as their second priority; voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth, tied with the war in Iraq.  Affordability was the primary health care priority among both sets of voters.  Obama voters were more likely than McCain voters to believe government can do much about health care costs.<ref>Robert J. Blendon, Drew E. Altman, John M.

====Race====
In an October 17–20, 2008, NBC News/''Wall Street Journal'' poll of registered voters, 2% said [[Race (human classification)|race]] made them more likely to vote for Barack Obama, 4% said it made them less likely to do so, and 2% were not sure. The other 92% of respondents said race was not a major factor in their vote.  (margin of error was ±2.9%).<ref>http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/081021_NBC-WSJ_Poll_Full.pdf#page=26</ref>

A July 18–21, 2008, NBC News/''Wall Street Journal'' poll showed that 20% of African American registered voters and 8% of white registered voters considered race the single most important factor when voting (margin of error was ±3.1%). This percentage increased in both groups from previous polls.<ref>http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/080723_NBC-WSJ_Combined.pdf#page=36</ref>

A June 6–9, 2008, NBC News/''Wall Street Journal'' poll showed that 17% were enthusiastic about Obama being the first African American president, 70% were comfortable or indifferent, and 13% had reservations or were uncomfortable (margin of error was ±3.1%).<ref>http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/080611_NBC-WSJ_Full.pdf#page=28</ref>

Obama generally avoided racial issues in his campaign. He would often place white people behind him when in a hall speaking to a large black group in order to avoid racial imagery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Staples|first=Robert|year=2010|title=The Post Racial Presidency: The Myths of a Nation and its People|journal=Journal Of African American Studies|volume=14|issue=1|page=130|doi=10.1007/s12111-009-9102-9}}</ref> On June 11, 2008, [[Fox News Channel]] used the phrase "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's [[baby mama]]" in an on screen graphic in a discussion as to whether U.S. presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]]'s wife, [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]], was being unfairly criticized.

===Debates===
{{Main|United States presidential election debates, 2008}}
The [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] announced four debates:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debates.org/pages/news_111907.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080713221138/http://www.debates.org/pages/news_111907.html|archivedate=July 13, 2008|title=CPD: Commission on Presidential Debates Announces 2004 Sites and Dates|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}</ref>
* September 26: The first presidential debate took place at the [[University of Mississippi]]. The central issues debated were supposed to be foreign policy and national security. However, due to the economic climate, some questions appeared on this topic. The debate was formatted into nine nine-minute segments, and the moderator, [[Jim Lehrer]] of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], introduced the topics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe|title=If held, tonight's debate could be key|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/26/MNUL1343DC.DTL&type=politics|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref>

* October 7: The second presidential debate took place at [[Belmont University]].

Another debate was sponsored by the [[Columbia University]] political union and took place there on October 19. All candidates who could theoretically win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election were invited, and [[Ralph Nader]], [[Cynthia McKinney]], and [[Chuck Baldwin]] agreed to attend. [[Amy Goodman]], principal host of ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', moderated. It was broadcast on cable by [[C-SPAN]] and on the Internet by Break-the-Matrix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freeandequal.org/events.php?id=7|title=Free and Equal|publisher=Freeandequal.org|accessdate=November 3, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081019015945/http://www.freeandequal.org/events.php?id=7 |archivedate=October 19, 2008}}</ref>

===Campaign costs===
{{Main|Fundraising for the 2008 United States presidential election}}
The reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004).<ref name="Toner">{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Kennedy|title=Wanna be Prez?

* [[Yes We Can (slogan)|Yes We Can]]: Obama's campaign slogan
* [[That One]]: McCain's reference to Obama during the 2nd debate.

===Fundraising===

{{see also|Grassroots fundraising}}
[[Howard Dean]] collected large contributions through the Internet in his 2004 primary run. In 2008, candidates went even further to reach out to Internet users through their own sites and such sites as [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], and [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/23/debate.main/|title=Questions, not answers, highlight YouTube debate|work=[[CNN]]|date=July 24, 2007|accessdate=March 14, 2008}}</ref><ref name="garry">{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/08/State/Candidates_court_youn.shtml|title=Candidates court young voters online|author=Stephanie Garry|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=June 8, 2007|accessdate=September 15, 2008}}</ref>

===Promotion===

Not only did the Internet allow candidates to raise money, but also it gave them a tool to appeal to newer and younger demographics. Political pundits were now evaluating candidates based on their social media following.
Senator Barack Obama's victory is credited to his competitive edge in social media and Internet following. Obama had over 2 million American supporters on [[Facebook]] and 100,000 followers on [[Twitter]], while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter. Obama's YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views.

Obama's edge in social media was crucial to the election outcome. According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life project, 35 percent of Americans relied on online video for election news. Ten percent of Americans used social networking sites to learn about the election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Media and the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|url=|publisher=Journal of New Communications Research <!--|accessdate=1 March 2014--> |author=Metzgar, Emily, and Albert Maruggi|location=}}</ref>   The 2008 election showed huge increases in Internet use.

Another study done after the election gave a lot of insight on young voters. Thirty-seven percent of Americans ages 18–24 got election news from social networking sites. Almost a quarter of Americans saw something about the election in an online video.<ref name="Cain Miller">{{cite news|last=Cain Miller|first=Claire|title=How Obama's Internet Campaign Changed Politics|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 Nov 2008}}</ref>   YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.

Social media allowed voters to share their voting experience. On November 5, 2008 at 10:30 p.m., 4.9 million Facebook users had already posted an announcement that they had voted, simply by checking a box on the site. Various websites allowed voters to share concerns over voting malfunctions, ballot shortages and other problems. [[Social media]] and the Internet provided a new and interactive voting experience.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Vote: A Victory for Social Media, Too.|accessdate=29 Feb 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Business Week|date=5 Nov 2008|author=Douglas MacMillan|author2=Arik Hesseldahl|author3=Olga Kharif}}</ref>

Democratic Party candidate [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#Internet supporters|Barack Obama]] created a broad popular movement and a new method of campaigning by courting and mobilizing activists, donations, and voters through the Internet. It was part of a campaign that mobilized grassroots workers in every state. Obama also set fundraising records in more than one month by gaining support from a record-breaking number of individual small donors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitwise.com/political-data-center/key-candidates.php|title=Top Presidential Candidate 2008 Websites|publisher=[[Hitwise]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081017115617/http://hitwise.com/political-data-center/key-candidates.php|archivedate=October 17, 2008}}</ref>

===News===

[[YouTube]] was considered to be a valuable asset for free advertising. Joe Trippi, the manager of Howard Dean's presidential campaign, claimed that Obama's YouTube campaign material was watched for 14.5 million hours, a viewing that would have cost $47 million for broadcast television.<ref name="Cain Miller"/>   YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.

The percentage of Americans who regularly rely on the Internet for campaign news almost doubled  (13 to 24 percent) from 2004 to 2008, according to a 2008 study from the Pew Research Center. The percentage of Americans who relied on traditional news sources was either stagnant or declining.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet's Broader Role in Campaign 2008|url=http://www.people-press.org/2008/01/11/internets-broader-role-in-campaign-2008/|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

A 2011 study by Ad Age magazine shows that 39 percent of voting-age social media users repost and share political messages. The study also recorded 1/3 of Facebook friends opening video or article links. The 2008 election was a catalyst for Internet use in American politics. Jay Samit, a writer at Ad Age magazine, predicted the 2012 election to be "the most participatory election in our nation's history" because of social media.<ref>{{cite web|last=Samit|first=Jay|title=Three Ways Social Media Will Make or Break 2012 Election Campaigns|url=<http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/social-media-make-break-2012-election-campaigns/228367/>|publisher=Ad Age Magazine|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Voter suppression===
Some pre-election controversies in the election revolved around challenges to [[voter registration]] lists, involving techniques such as [[caging (voter suppression)|caging lists]] alleged to constitute [[voter suppression]].

Allegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six [[swing states]]: [[Colorado]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Nevada]] and [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html|title=States' Actions to Block Voters Appear Illegal|publisher=The New York Times|author=Ian Urbina|date=October 9, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2008}}</ref> On October 5, 2008 the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Lt.

[[Virginia]] election authorities were ordered by a federal judge to preserve late-arriving [[absentee ballots]] sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign.

In [[Ohio]], identified by both parties as a key state, allegations surfaced from both Republicans and Democrats that individuals from out of state were moving to the state temporarily and attempting to vote despite not meeting the state's requirement of permanent residency for more than 29 days.

===Media bias===
Republicans leveled significant criticism at media outlets' coverage of the presidential election season. An October 22, 2008 [[Pew Research Center]] poll estimated 70% of registered voters believed journalists wanted Barack Obama to win the election, as opposed to 9% for John McCain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most Voters Say Media Wants Obama to Win|publisher=The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press|date=October 22, 2008|url=http://people-press.org/report/463/media-wants-obama}}</ref> Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair. Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair. Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain.<ref>[http://www.people-press.org/2008/11/13/section-5-the-press-and-campaign-2008/ High Marks for the Campaign, a High Bar for Obama] Pew Research Center.

At the February debate, [[Tim Russert]] of [[NBC News]] was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name="Who Lost"/> Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide the name of the new [[President of Russia|Russian President]] ([[Dmitry Medvedev]]).<ref name="Who Lost"/> This was later parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

[[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] was on November 4, 2008. The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting.<ref>[http://earlyvoting.net/states/abslaws.php Absentee and Early Voting Laws], from the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College</ref> Voters cast votes for listed presidential candidates but were actually selecting representatives for their state's [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] slate.

A McCain victory quickly became improbable as Obama amassed early wins in his home state of [[United States presidential election in Illinois, 2008|Illinois]], the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and the critical battleground states of [[United States presidential election in Ohio, 2008|Ohio]] (which no Republican has ever been elected President without winning) and [[United States presidential election in Pennsylvania, 2008|Pennsylvania]] by 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/11/04/1639565.aspx|title=NBC calls Ohio for Obama—First Read—msnbc.com|publisher=Firstread.msnbc.msn.com|date=November 4, 2008|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes states]] of [[United States presidential election in Michigan, 2008|Michigan]], [[United States presidential election in Wisconsin, 2008|Wisconsin]], and [[United States presidential election in Minnesota, 2008|Minnesota]] by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like [[United States presidential election in North Dakota, 2008|North Dakota]], [[United States presidential election in South Dakota, 2008|South Dakota]], [[United States presidential election in Nebraska, 2008|Nebraska]], [[United States presidential election in Kansas, 2008|Kansas]], [[United States presidential election in Oklahoma, 2008|Oklahoma]], [[United States presidential election in Montana, 2008|Montana]], [[United States presidential election in Utah, 2008|Utah]], [[United States presidential election in Idaho, 2008|Idaho]], [[United States presidential election in Wyoming, 2008|Wyoming]], and his home state of [[United States presidential election in Arizona, 2008|Arizona]]. McCain, unlike Bush in 2000 and 2004, failed to win all the southern states: Obama won [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2008|Florida]], [[United States presidential election in North Carolina, 2008|North Carolina]], and [[United States presidential election in Virginia, 2008|Virginia]]. Obama also won the hotly contested states of [[United States presidential election in Iowa, 2008|Iowa]] and [[United States presidential election in New Mexico, 2008|New Mexico]], which [[Al Gore]] had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]] ([[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] being the other), [[United States presidential election in Indiana, 2008|Indiana]] went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since [[United States presidential election, 1972|Richard Nixon in 1972]].

[[CNN]] and [[Fox News]] called Virginia for Obama shortly before 11:00 PM, leaving him only 50 electoral votes shy of victory with only six [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] states ([[United States presidential election in California, 2008|California]], [[United States presidential election in Oregon, 2008|Oregon]], [[United States presidential election in Washington, 2008|Washington]], [[United States presidential election in Idaho, 2008|Idaho]], [[United States presidential election in Alaska, 2008|Alaska]], and [[United States presidential election in Hawaii, 2008|Hawaii]]) still voting. All American networks called the election in favor of Obama at 11:00 PM as the polls closed on the West Coast. Obama was immediately declared the winner in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, McCain won Idaho, and the Electoral College totals were updated to 297 for Obama and 146 for McCain (270 are needed to win). McCain gave a concession speech half an hour later in his hometown of [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Fouhy|first=Beth|title=McCain concedes presidency, congratulates Obama|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2008/11/05/101691-mccain-concedes-presidency-congratulates-obama/|work=[[Tucson Citizen]]|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> Obama appeared just before midnight Eastern Time in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Chicago]], in front of a crowd of 250,000 people to deliver his [[Barack Obama election victory speech, 2008|victory speech]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Meincke|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/politics&id=6490862|title=Chicago could benefit from Obama election|publisher=[[WLS-TV]]|location=Chicago|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

Later on election night, after Obama was named the winner, he picked up several more wins in swing states in which the polls had shown a close race. These included [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Virginia]], and the western states of [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]]. All of these states had been carried by Bush in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]. [[North Carolina]] and the [[Missouri bellwether|bellwether]] state of [[Missouri]] remained undecided for several days. Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri, with Obama pulling out a rare win in [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district]]. This put the projected electoral vote count at 365 for Obama and 173 for McCain. Obama's victories in the populous swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia contributed to his decisive win. The presidential electors cast their ballots for President and Vice President, and Congress tallied these votes on January 8, 2009.<ref name="house floor summary"/>

Kennedy]]/[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]] ([[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]/[[Henry A. Wallace]]). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]].

[[Image:Election-state-04-08.png|thumb|250px|Swing by state. States are listed by (increasing) percentage of Democratic votes, showing how the share of the vote changed between [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] and 2008. Only five states trended more Republican: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia.]]

Prior to the election, commentators discussed whether Senator Obama would be able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressillinois.com/2008/05/11/features/obama-over-the-top|title=Obama Over the Top: How New Voters Could Redraw The Electoral Map|publisher=Progress Illinois|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}</ref> In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won [[Delaware]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], [[Florida]], and [[Virginia]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] (region as defined by the US [[Census Bureau]]). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades.<ref>[http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/national-exit-polls.html Exit Polls], ''The New York Times'', November 5, 2008.</ref> Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing [[Missouri]] since [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]] (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] since [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]]. He was the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning [[West Virginia]] since [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]] and the first Democrat to win without [[Arkansas]] since that state joined the Union in 1836. [[Indiana]] and [[Virginia]] voted for the Democratic nominee for the first time since [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]]. Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Montana]] (which were won by [[Bill Clinton]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.

Obama was the first presidential candidate to split the electoral votes from [[Nebraska]]. Together with [[Maine]], which has not yet split its electoral votes, Nebraska is one of two states that split their electoral votes, two going to the statewide popular vote winner and the rest going to the winner of each respective congressional district (Nebraska has three, and Maine has two). Obama won the electoral vote from [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district]], which contains the city of [[Omaha]]. Nebraska's other four electoral votes went to John McCain.

This election exhibited the continuation of some of the polarization trends evident in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and 2004 elections.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cost|first=Jay|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/horseraceblog/2008/11/polarization_continues_under_o.html|title=HorseRaceBlog—Electoral Polarization Continues Under Obama|publisher=RealClearPolitics|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> McCain won whites 55-43 percent, while Obama won blacks 95-4 percent,<ref>{{cite web|author=Kuhn, David Paul |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15297.html|title=Exit polls: How Obama won|work=Politico|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> Hispanics 67-31 percent, and Asians 62-35 percent.
