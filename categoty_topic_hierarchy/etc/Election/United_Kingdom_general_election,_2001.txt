The '''United Kingdom general election, 2001''' was held on Thursday 7 June 2001 to elect [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2001|659 members]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]. It was dubbed "the quiet landslide" by the media, as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was re-elected with another landslide result and only suffered a net loss of 5 seats, with lower turnout of 59.4%, compared to 71.3% in the previous election. [[Tony Blair]] went on to become the first Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to serve a second consecutive full term in office.

There was little change outside [[Northern Ireland]], with 620 out of the 641 seats electing candidates from the same party as they did in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. Factors contributing to the Labour victory were a strong economy and falling unemployment, as well as the fact that Labour delivered on many key election pledges that it had made in 1997. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], under [[William Hague]]'s leadership, was still deeply divided on the issue of [[European Union|Europe]] and the party's policy platform was considered to have shifted to a right-wing focus. Hague was also hindered by a series of embarrassing publicity stunts, and resigned as party leader three months later, becoming the first Conservative leader since [[Austen Chamberlain]] to leave office without becoming [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

The election was essentially a repeat of the 1997 election, with Labour losing only 6 seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of 1 seat (gaining 9 seats, but losing 8). The Conservatives did manage to gain a seat in [[Scotland]], which ended the party's status as an 'England-only' party in the prior parliament. Although they did not gain many seats, one of the new MPs elected was future Conservative Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. The [[Liberal Democrats]] gained 6 seats.

Change was seen in [[Northern Ireland]], with the moderately [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Ulster Unionist Party]] losing 4 seats to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]].  This transition was mirrored in the [[Irish Republicanism|republican]] community with the moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] losing votes to the more staunchly republican and abstentionist [[Sinn Féin]].

The election was also marked with exceptionally low voter turnout, falling below 60% for the first time since 1918.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election Statistics: UK 1918-2007|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2008/rp08-012.pdf|page=18|date=1 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The election was broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Andrew Marr]], [[Peter Snow]] and [[David Dimbleby]].<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6weF6Q37F2w&feature=mfu_in_order&playnext=1&videos=UsHbCo8smUk| BBC Vote 2001 Coverage</ref>

==Overview==
The election had been expected on 3 May, to coincide with [[United Kingdom local elections, 2001|local elections]], but both were postponed because of rural movement restrictions imposed in response to the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|foot and mouth outbreak]].

The elections were marked by voter apathy, with turnout falling to 59.4%, the lowest since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|Coupon Election]] of 1918. Throughout the election the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some [[bookmaker]]s paid out for a Labour majority before the election day. However, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as they benefited from the public anger towards the government over the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel. By the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been solved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls.

In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref>

One of the more noted events of a quiet campaign was when countryside protester Craig Evans threw an egg at [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] in [[Rhyl]]; Prescott then punched him and a struggle ensued, in front of television cameras. 2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr. Richard Taylor]] of [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] (usually now known simply as "Health Concern") unseated a government minister. There was also a high vote for [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] in [[Oldham]], in the wake of recent race riots in the town.

In [[Northern Ireland]], the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] away from support for the [[Good Friday Agreement]], with the moderate unionist [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican [[Sinn Féin]]. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small [[UK Unionist Party]] lost its only seat.

==Campaign==
For Labour the last 4 years had run relatively smoothly. The party had successfully defended all their [[List of United Kingdom by-elections|by-election]] seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start. Many in the party however were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in the iconic "Hague with Lady Thatcher's hair" poster.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Get out and vote. Or they get in.}}</ref> Despite Recessions in Mainland Europe and the US due to the bursting of global tech bubbles. Britain was notably unaffected and Labour however could rely on a strong economy as unemployment continued to decline toward election day, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.

For [[William Hague]], however, the Conservative Party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on the Euro was rife. As Labour remained at the political centre the Tories inevitably moved to the right. A policy gaffe by [[Oliver Letwin]] over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon took advantage of. [[Margaret Thatcher]] also added to Hague's troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at PMQs, was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech at Conservative conference at the age of 16. The Sun newspaper only added to the Conservatives woes by backing Labour once again, calling Hague a "dead parrot"<ref>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/STaU-tJdVzI/AAAAAAAAASA/GVBGsJaLKAI/s400/PARROT-HAGUE.jpg</ref>

The Tories campaigned on a strongly right-wing platform, emphasising the issues of Europe, immigration and tax, the fabled [[Norman Tebbit|"Tebbit Trinity"]]. However, Labour countered by asking where the proposed tax cuts were going to come from, and decried the Tory policy as "cut here, cut there, cut everywhere", in reference to the widespread belief that the Conservatives would make major cuts to public services in order to fund tax cuts.

For the Liberal Democrats this was the first election for leader [[Charles Kennedy]], who received a good amount of coverage and ultimately left the campaign for the better.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>

==Controversy==
During the election Sharron Storer, a resident of [[Birmingham]], criticised Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in front of television cameras about conditions in the [[National Health Service]]. The widely-televised incident happened on 16 May during a campaign visit by Blair to the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in Birmingham. Sharron Storer's [[domestic partner|partner]], Keith Sedgewick, a cancer patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and therefore highly susceptible to infection, was being treated at the time in the [[bone marrow]] unit, but no bed could be found for him and he was transferred to the casualty unit for his first 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Government and Politics: A Comparative Guide |author=Duncan Watts|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MiTDykvtbEkC&pg=PA320&lpg=PA320&dq=%22Sharron+Storer%22|isbn=978-0-7486-2323-5|postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334131.stm BBC story from 16 May 2001]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334903.stm BBC story from 17 May 2001]</ref>

==Opinion polling==
{{main|Opinion polling for the United Kingdom general election, 2001}}

==Results==
The election was effectively a repeat of 1997, as the Labour party vindicated the faith placed in it 4 years ago, and thus  retained an overwhelming majority. Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the UK had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament.
Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60% for the first time in history, 12% down on 1997. All of the 3 main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | work=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}</ref>

For the Conservatives, the huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining 9 seats the Tories lost 8 behind them to the Liberal Democrats and one even to Labour. The inevitable result was the speedy resignation of [[William Hague]] in the election aftermath. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky, although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic [[Tony Blair]] in the pomp of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament. Staying at what they considered rock-bottom however showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1377000/1377378.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour romps home again | date=8 June 2001}}</ref>

The Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under [[Charles Kennedy]], gaining more seats than the main two parties – albeit only six overall – and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in parliament and not just representing a protest vote.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The SNP failed to gain any seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. Plaid Cymru gained and lost a seat to Labour respectively. 

In [[2001 United Kingdom general election results in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] the Ulster Unionists, despite gaining North Down, lost 5 seats behind them.
