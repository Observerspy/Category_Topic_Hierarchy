{{Politics of Turkey}}
The '''2000 Turkish presidential election''' consisted of a first round election on 27 April 2000 followed by a second round vote on 1 May and a third on 5 May. It occurred at the end of 9th president [[Süleyman Demirel]]'s seven-year term in office. There was a small effort to convert Turkey's [[President of Turkey|presidential system]] into two terms of five years each, which would have given Demirel an additional three years, but this proposal never found widespread support.

In the months leading to the vote, each of the five largest parliamentary parties informally endorsed their own candidates. However, with their no party with a defining majority, a neutral compromise candidate was sought and eventually found in the form of [[Ahmet Necdet Sezer]], then chief justice at Turkey's [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]]. Sezer was endorsed by the leaders of the governing [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left]], [[Nationalist Action Party|Nationalist Action]] and [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland]] parties, as well as the leaders of the opposition [[Virtue Party|Virtue]] and [[True Path Party|True Path]] parties.

A number of MPs broke from party lines to nominate themselves. Among them was parliament speaker and former prime minister [[Yıldırım Akbulut]], who was unable to win popular support and withdrew after the second round.

==Procedure==

The presidential vote is held in parliament by [[secret ballot]]. A candidate requires a [[two-thirds majority]] - or 367 votes - to be elected in the first two rounds. If there is no clear winner before the third round, the winning threshold is dropped to a [[majority|simple majority]], or 276 votes. If there is still no winner, the two candidates with the most votes from the third round progress to a runoff election, where the simply majority rule still applies. In the event of no clear winner among the two, the Turkish constitution states that a snap general election must be called to overcome the parliamentary deadlock.
