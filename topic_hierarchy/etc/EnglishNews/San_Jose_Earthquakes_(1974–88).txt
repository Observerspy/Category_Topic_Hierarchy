The Quakes swept through the tournament unscathed, defeating the Tampa Bay Rowdies 8-5 in the final to the delight of their fans. San Jose teammates Paul Child (soccer)|Paul Child and Mom?ilo Gavri? (footballer)|Gabbo Garvic were named co-MVPs. In 1976 NASL Indoor tournament|1976 the Earthquakes again advanced to the final four before losing to the Rochester Lancers at the Bayfront Center in Florida. They would rebound the following day to win the 3rd Place match 5-2 over Dallas Tornado|Dallas. The NASL would not begin playing full indoor seasons until 1979–80 NASL Indoor season|1979-80, but San Jose did not fair nearly as well in that format. The NASL canceled their 1982–83 indoor season.
