On 13 March, the '''1992 Erzincan earthquake''' struck Eastern Turkey. Originating on the North Anatolian Fault, it rocked the country, leaving more than 497 people dead, roughly 2,000 injured, and an unknown amount missing.

{{see also|Geology of Turkey}}

Eastern Turkey is dominated by the North Anatolian Fault. The Erzincan basin lies on the intersection of this fault on its northern side. Monitored by more than 10 seismographs, this basin has also provided focal points to at least one past earthquake in 1939.

The provision of housing following the earthquake is now listed by the Chamber of Civil Engineers in Turkey as one of Fifty civil engineering feats in Turkey.
