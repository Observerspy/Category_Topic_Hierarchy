<!--File:1976 papua indonesia earthquake intensity map.jpg|thumb|United States Geological Survey ShakeMap-->
Indonesia lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a sector of the Pacific where several plate tectonics|tectonic plates intersect. This movement between the plates results in extremely high volcanic and seismic activity. Papua, Indonesia|Papua is constantly plagued by landslides.

== Damage and casualties ==
Directly after the earthquake the casualty count was assessed as 350 dead. However, landslides soon occurred in the affected area, leading to 72 more casualties. 5,000-9,000 were missing after the landslides, and were assumed dead.
