The {{nihongo|'''1855 Edo earthquake'''|安政江戸地震|Ansei Edo Jishin}}, also known as the '''Great Ansei Earthquake,''' was one of the major disasters of the late-Edo period. The earthquake triggered a minor tsunami.

==Tectonic setting==
The Kanto area lies above a complex part of the convergent boundary|convergent boundaries between the subduction|subducting Pacific Plate|Pacific and Philippine Sea Plates and the overriding Eurasian Plate. Earthquakes with epicenters in the Kanto region may occur within the Eurasian Plate, at the Eurasaian Plate/Philippine Sea Plate interface, within the Philippine Sea Plate, at the Philippine Sea Plate/Pacific Plate interface or within the Pacific Plate. In addition to this set of major plates it has been suggested that there is also a separate 25&nbsp;km thick, 100&nbsp;km wide body, a fragment of Pacific Plate lithosphere. The 1855 earthquake is consistent with a rupture along the interface between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates, adjacent to, and down dip from, the rupture that caused the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

==Damage==
A total of about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either destroyed by the earthquake shaking or subsequent fires.  The area burned down in Edo was about 2.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

==Characteristics==
The earthquake was followed by 78 aftershocks in the first month.

==Aftermath==
Two days after the earthquake, prints began to appear, with more than 400 different types being available in the following weeks. Most of the prints depicted giant catfish, a type of image known as Namazu (Japanese mythology)|Namazu-e. The significance being that earthquakes at the time were popularly attributed to the thrashing about of a mythological catfish under the earth, normally kept under control by the deity Kashima using a large rock. The number of prints produced during the 1855 earthquake was unprecedented and has been related to the political and social effects of the disaster. The prints show the people's anger with Kashima who became replaced by the solar deity Amaterasu. Some of the prints also depict the redistribution of wealth. The earthquake has been described as an act of ''yonaoshi'' or 'world rectification', in the light of the two 1854 Ansei-Tōkai earthquake|great 1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake|earthquakes of 1854 and the arrival of Matthew C. Perry|Perry's Black Ships in 1853.

===Era of Disaster===
Three large earthquakes, the 1854 Ansei-Tōkai earthquake, 1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake, and the 1855 Ansei Edo earthquake are collectively called the Ansei Great Earthquakes (安政の大地震, ''Ansei no Dai Jishin'').   Combining the effects of these disasters with a major cholera outbreak killing over 100,000 people, a fire at Edo Castle, and the 1858 Hietsu earthquake, the Ansei era was one of quite catastrophic upheaval.  Due to the cumulative effects of these disasters, the reign name was changed in 1860 to usher in a 'clean slate' and better "fortune".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
