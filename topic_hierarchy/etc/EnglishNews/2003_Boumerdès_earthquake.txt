The '''2003 Boumerdès earthquake''' was a Moment magnitude scale|magnitude 6.8 M<sub>w</sub> earthquake that occurred on May 21, 2003 in northern Algeria. The quake was the strongest to hit Algeria in more than twenty years since 1980, when a magnitude 7.3 earthquake resulted in 3,500 deaths.

==Tectonics==
Northern Algeria is situated at the boundary between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, thus creating a zone of Compression (geology)|compression. This zone of compression manifests itself by several thrust and Fault (geology)|faults. According to the United States Geological Survey,
{{quotation|The earthquake occurred in the boundary region between the Eurasian plate and the African plate. Along this section of the plate boundary, the African plate is moving northwestward against the Eurasian plate with a velocity of about 6 mm per year. The relative plate motions create a compressional tectonic environment, in which earthquakes occur by thrust-faulting and strike-slip faulting. Analysis of seismic waves generated by this earthquake shows that it occurred as the result of thrust-faulting.}}

==Damages and casualties==

Approximately 2,266 people were killed, 10,261 injured, and 200,000 left homeless as a result of the earthquake. 

The quake generated a localized tsunami, which damaged boats off the coast of the Balearic Islands. overall, the Boumerdès Province was the hardest-hit region. Many buildings built in the early twentieth century during the French Algeria|colonial rule suffered heavy damage in the Belcourt, Bab-El-Oued and El-Casbah areas in Algiers Province.

According to the Algerian Ministry of Housing, in the Algiers Province only approximately 554 schools suffered light damage, while nearly 330 schools received moderate damage and 11 were heavily damaged or completely destroyed.

A water treatment plant in Boudouaou, which provides more than 12% of the treated water to the Boumerdès and Algiers, suffered light damage to the clarifiers and clear water storage tanks. The water pipeline from the Keddara Dam to the water treatment plant was broken at a concrete junction structure at the dam, as well as at the treatment plant. The main power plant in Cap Djenet suffered minor to moderate damage. A high voltage switch yard located near Régha?a had heavy damage.

SNTF|Societé Nationale des Transports Ferrovaires, Algeria's state-owned railway company, suffered track damage near the town of Thénia. Some tracks were also blocked by debris of destroyed buildings. Eighteen bridges in the affected region had minor to moderate damage. Cracks developed in some roads and highways. The port of Algiers, which at that time handled approximately 40% of the national cargo traffic, suffered light to moderate damage due to soil liquefaction and Settlement (structural)|settlement caused by the earthquake. Port operations was reportedly reduced by 30% immediately after the quake. The minor ports in Zemmouri and Dellys received little damage.

The earthquake had significant effect on local communication. An 8,000 switch central office in the El Harrach area of Algiers completely destroyed and another 20,000 switch office was heavily damaged. Submarine telecommunication cables also suffered damage. Two underwater fiber optic cables between Algeria and Spain received heavy damage due to undersea landslide caused by the quake.

==Relief efforts==
Many nations sent rescue teams to help in the search for earthquake survivors. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement co-ordinated the relief efforts. Medical and rescue teams were dispatched from European countries. The Red Cross of the People's Republic of China donated $50,000. Army units were deployed to assist the relief effort.

===Response from other countries===
*{{flag|Canada}}: Canada pledged approximately $150,000 for search and rescue works to find survivors.

===Public anger===
There was anger among the survivors over the fact that the local authorities did not provide them with temporary shelters. The effects of the earthquake became worse because the construction industry in Algeria did not apply rigorous safety standards of earthquake engineering to build earthquake-proof buildings New housing blocks constructed by the government and by individual builders were destroyed by the quake, This was another cause of public anger. Some people claimed that officials saved money by using below-standard material in construction projects. Many angry protesters threw debris when President of Algeria|President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Minister of State for the Interior and Local Authorities, Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni, tried to visit some affected regions. A crowd kicked and stoned the car of Bouteflika when he visited Boumerdès shouting ''"pouvoir assassin"''. Prime Minister Ouyahia expressed the view of possibility of corruption in the construction sector. A commission of inquiry was set up by the government to investigate the faulty construction of several buildings which collapsed in the quake.
