The '''1983 Borah Peak earthquake''' occurred on October 28, 1983, in the Lost River Range at Borah Peak in Central Idaho|central Idaho, United States. The most significant earthquake recorded in the state, it occurred on a Friday morning at 8:06 am Mountain Time Zone|MDT.  The earthquake measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and 6.9 on the Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale.

==Geography==
Along with being the largest, it is almost the most damaging earthquake as well. Two children were killed by falling masonry while walking to school in Challis, Idaho|Challis, about 120 miles (200 km) northeast of Boise, Idaho|Boise, the state's capital. $12.5 million in damage took place in the Challis-Mackay region. Maximum Mercalli scale intensity IX damage was decided upon, as a result of extreme surface faulting, while vibrational damage was at a Mercalli intensity of VI to VII.

The rupture caused clear surface faulting&nbsp; a 21 mile (34 km) long northwest moving zone of fresh fault scarp|scarps and ground rupture was present on a slope of the Lost River Range. Extensive breakage occurred along a 5 mile (8 km) zone between West Spring and Cedar Creek; ground surface was literally "shattered" into tilted blocks, each meters in width. These scarps were as broad as 330 feet (100 m).

==Damage==
The Challis-Mackay region experienced rather thorough damage, with 11 commercial buildings and 39 homes with major damage; while another 200 houses were damaged, minor to moderately. Mackay, Idaho|Mackay in particular, about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Challis, Idaho|Challis, experienced the most severe damage. Most of the city's large buildings on its Main Street were damaged, to some extent; eight of these buildings were deemed condemned and closed down. Most of these buildings were built from materials such as brick, concrete block, and stone, each varying.

==Artesian fountains==

Near Chilly Buttes of Thousand Springs Valley, a series of artesian fountains/sand blows erupted immediately after the main shock of the 1983 Borah Peak earthquake.   Groundwater gushed from these fountains forming small craters and depositing aprons of light-colored sandy sediment around each crater.
