The '''1931 Central China floods''' or the '''Central China floods of 1931''' were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). to between 3.7 million and 4 million.

==Meteorological causes==
From 1928 to 1930, a long drought afflicted China. By some accounts, abnormal weather over central China began in the winter of late 1930. Heavy snowstorms in the winter were followed by a spring thaw and heavy rains that raised river levels significantly.  The rain grew heavier in July and August 1931. 1931 was also characterized by extreme cyclone activity&mdash;in July of that year alone, seven cyclones hit the region, whereas on average only two occur per year.

==Death toll and damage==
Chinese sources usually indicate the death toll of the Yangtze River overflow at about 145,000, with flood damage affecting around 28.5 million, while most Western sources give a far higher death toll of between 3.7 and 4 million people.

===Yangtze River===
The worst period of flooding was from July to August 1931. In July alone, four weather stations along the Yangtze River reported rain totaling over {{convert|2|ft|in}} for the month.

===Huai River===
The Yangtze and Huai River floods soon reached Nanjing, the Historical capitals of China|capital of China at the time. The city, located on an island in a massive flood zone, suffered catastrophic damage. On the evening of 25 August 1931, the water rushing through the Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal washed away Dike (construction)|dikes near Gaoyou Lake. Some 200,000 people drowned in their sleep in the resulting deluge.

==Government reactions==
===Republic era (1930s–1940s)===
In the wake of the disaster, the Kuomintang|Nationalist government set up organizations such as the Huai River Conservancy Commission to address flood problems.

===Communist era (1949–present)===
In 1953, after the end of the Civil War, Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong travelled to the Yangtze River to promote the Three Gorges Dam flood control project. "The Socialist Three Gorges Dam project should excel other major projects in Chinese history such as Qin Shi Huang's Great Wall of China|Great Wall and Emperor Yang of Sui|Sui Yang Di's Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal", he stated.

Scientists and officials who raised doubts, such as Chen Mingshu, were persecuted as Anti-Rightist Movement|rightists. Li Siguang, a prominent scientist and minister of geological resources, told Mao he would commit suicide if he could not stop the construction of the dam.
