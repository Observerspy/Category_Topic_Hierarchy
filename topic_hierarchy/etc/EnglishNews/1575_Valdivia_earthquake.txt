The '''1575 Valdivia earthquake''' occurred in Chile and caused the subsequent flood of Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia much like the 1960 Valdivia earthquake caused the ensuing Ri?ihuazo flooding.  It occurred at 14:30 local time on December 16, 1575. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale. Pedro Mari?o de Lobera, who was Corregidor (position)|corregidor of Valdivia by that time, wrote that the waters of the river opened like the Red Sea, one part flowing upstream and one downstream. Mari?o de Lobera also evacuated the city until the dam at ''Laguna de Anigua'' (nowadays Ri?ihue Lake) burst. At that moment he wrote that, while many Indians died, no Spaniards did, as the settlement of Valdivia was moved temporarily away from the riverside.
