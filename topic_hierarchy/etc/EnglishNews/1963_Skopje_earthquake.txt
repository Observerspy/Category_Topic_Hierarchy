Within days after the earthquake took place, 35 nations requested that the United Nations General Assembly place relief for Skopje on their list of agendas. Relief, in the form of money, medical, engineering and building teams and supplies was offered from 78 countries.

The then-United States president John F. Kennedy ordered the United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense and the Agency for International Development (USAID) to take actions for disaster assistance in Skopje by sending personnel, prefabricated houses, Tent city|tent cities and other forms of relief. Large amount of relief also arrived from the Soviet Union. Its leader, Nikita Khrushchev, visited Skopje personally. As the SFR Yugoslavia was a member of the Non Aligned Movement during the Cold War, the American and Soviet troops stationed in Skopje could freely shake hands for the first time since their historical Elbe Day|encounter on Elbe in 1945.

The first foreign journalist who arrived in Skopje to report on the earthquake was David Binder (journalist)|David Binder of the ''New York Times''. As he watched Skopje from the plane, he commented that the city looked like it was Aerial bombing of cities|bombed.

The United Kingdom-based engineer Demetrius Comino provided Dexion building frame materials to enable 49 Royal Engineers to build 1560 dwellings, enough for two complete villages, one of which was nicknamed Dexiongrad. Dexion belongs to the Skopje's Municipality of Gjor?e Petrov.

In 1965, the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange was asked by the United Nations to enter a limited competition for the redevelopment of Skopje, after which Tange won 60% of the prize while the Yugoslav team won the remaining 40%. However, Tange's plan for Skopje (one of his major works) remains partly implemented, specifically concerning the New Skopje Railway Station and the so-called City Wall.

As the city gradually began to recover, the need for revival of cultural life arose. The famous artist Pablo Picasso donated his painting ''Head of a Woman (Bosch)|Head of a Woman'' (1963), which was exhibited in the new post-earthquake Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia. http://www.msuskopje.org.mk/?sid=410&lid=1 http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID=27935&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/instInfo/inst/2740 The museum building was a donation from Poland and was designed by several notable Polish architects. http://www.msuskopje.org.mk/msu.php?mode=nav&mid=7&id=11 The concert hall "Univerzalna sala" was built with donations from around 35 countries and its prefabricated building was made in neighbouring Bulgaria.http://univerzalna.com.mk/MK/za_nas/istorija.aspx 

Several streets and objects in Skopje were named in honor of the countries which helped in their construction and/or donated housing. For example, the government of Romania donated the polyclinic medical center, which was named after its capital, Bucharest. In Karposh Municipality, there are soviet-donated apartment buildings called in macedonian language|macedonian: ?руски згради“ (Transliteration of Macedonian|trаnslit.: "ruski zgradi", meaning "Russian buildings") and Sweden|Swedish and Finland|Finnish prefabricated building|prefabs called ?шведски / фински бараки“ ("?vedski / finski baraki").

One notable example is Skopje's ''Mexico Street'' (улица Мексичка, ulica Meksi?ka). It was officially named in honor of the country Mexico and a memorial plaque from the Mexican president Adolfo López Mateos was unveiled at the location. In 2012, the street's most notable resident, the rock musician Vlatko Stefanovski and his brother, the playwright Goran Stefanovski protested against the mayor's decision to rename several city streets, including Mexico Street. The Stefanovski brothers reminded people that the street they grew up on and where the notable Macedonian rock group Leb i sol was formed was built with donations from Mexico and argued that this act of solidarity must never be forgotten. 

Being rebuilt from ruins thanks to the relief from all around the world, Skopje is often referred to as "The City of International Solidarity", which is its motto.
