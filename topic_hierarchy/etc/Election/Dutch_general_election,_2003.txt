'''General elections''' were held in the [[Netherlands]] on 22 January 2003.<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1396 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7</ref>

==Background==
The election was held following the resignation of the [[first Balkenende cabinet]] on 16 October 2002 after conflicts attributed to the [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], the new party of the already deceased [[Pim Fortuyn]].

In the early days of the campaign the [[Christen-Democratisch Appèl|CDA]] of incumbent [[prime minister]] [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] and the [[Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie|VVD]], the smallest [[coalition]] [[political party|party]], saw a major lead.

After TV debates the [[Partij van de Arbeid|PvdA]] (which had experienced a landslide defeat in the 2002 general election) of [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] leader [[Wouter Bos]] caught up, overtaking the VVD and regaining some of the territory lost in the previous election. The PvdA also held a [[2002 PvdA leadership election|leadership election]] which got the party considerable attention.

==Results==
{{see also|2003 Dutch cabinet formation}}

The LPF lost as spectacularly as it won in 2002, with its seat count dropping from 26 to 8.

The exciting race of which party would become the largest was eventually won by the CDA, which went from 43 to 44 seats, ensuring a continuation of Balkenende’s career as prime minister.

Most of the smaller parties on both the left and right side did not experience significant changes. Several other parties (among them [[Leefbaar Nederland]], a 2002 newcomer) didn’t manage to get over the threshold and thus gained no seats. They are not listed here.

After severe disagreements had frustrated the formation of a CDA-PvdA cabinet, a CDA-VVD-D66 cabinet was formed on 27 May 2003, with Balkenende as prime minister.
