The [[writ of election|writs of election]] for the 2011 election were issued by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[David Johnston]] on March&nbsp;26. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] advised the Governor General to dissolve parliament after the House of Commons passed a [[motion of no confidence|motion of non-confidence]] against the government, finding it to be in [[contempt of parliament]]. A few days before, the three opposition parties had rejected the government's proposed budget.<ref name="macleans1">{{cite web|last=Wells |first=Paul |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/05/05/not-feeling-the-love/ |title=The untold story of the 2011 election: Chapter 2 |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>

The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] remained in power, increasing their seat count from a [[minority government|minority]] to a [[majority government]]. The [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] won the fewest seats in their history, and party leader [[Michael Ignatieff]] was defeated in [[Etobicoke—Lakeshore|his riding]]. The [[Bloc Québécois]] lost [[official party status]] for the first time since contesting general elections in 1993. Party leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] was defeated in [[Laurier—Sainte-Marie|his riding]] and subsequently resigned as leader. The [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] won the largest number of seats in their history, enabling them to form the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] for the first time.

==Background==
{{main|40th Canadian Parliament}}
The [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]] resulted in the continuation of the incumbent [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] minority government, headed by [[Stephen Harper]]. The 40th Parliament was marked by two controversial [[prorogation in Canada|prorogations]]: the first in December 2008 which ended an [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute|attempted opposition coalition]], and the second a year following, which prompted [[2010 Canada anti-prorogation protests|public protests]]. Following the first prorogation, Ignatieff and the Liberal Party provided support for the government of Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]. On August 31, 2009, the Liberals withdrew their backing but the NDP under [[Jack Layton]] abstained and the Conservatives survived the confidence motion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCATRE58T4BE20091001 |title=Canada's government survives non-confidence motion &#124; Canada &#124; Reuters |publisher=Ca.reuters.com |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>
Ignatieff's attempt to force a September 2009 election was reported as a miscalculation, as polls showed that most Canadians did not want another election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Despite Election Rhetoric, Seven in Ten (68%) Canadians Say There's 'No Need for an Election', Majority (51%) Says County Heading in 'Right Direction', Minority (41%) 'Wrong', Ipsos |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=4420|publisher=Ipsos Market Research |accessdate=December 18, 2011|date=June 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Time to make minority work|url=http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/article/696242|publisher=The Star|accessdate=December 17, 2011|date=September 16, 2009}}</ref> Ignatieff's popularity as well as that of the Liberals dropped off considerably immediately afterwards.<ref>[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=2221709 Ignatieff closing in on Dion territory] National Post:November 14, 2009{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

* Bloc Québécois: "Parlons Québec"
* Conservative Party: "Here For Canada / Ici pour le Canada". In francophone Quebec, Harper ran under the slogan "Notre région au pouvoir" (our region to power).<ref name="quebecslogan">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2011/04/here-for-canada-except-in-quebec.html |title=Here in Canada except in Quebec |work=CBC |location=Canada |date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

* Green Party: "It's Time" & "Canada needs Elizabeth May but only you can elect her"
* Liberal Party: "Rise Up Canada" & "Change we need, from a proven team." The first one refers to Harper's contempt charge. The second one was used after the NDP's surge in the opinion polls making reference to the fact they never formed a government and have relatively inexperienced candidates.
* New Democratic Party: "Working For Families / Travaillons ensemble", "You have a choice", & "That's Canadian Leadership"

====Voter suppression scandal====

{{main|2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal}}

In early 2012, there were allegations of voter suppression during the election, starting the [[robocall scandal]]. [[Elections Canada]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) are investigating claims that robocalls were used in an attempt to dissuade voters from casting their ballot by telling them their poll stations had changed location.<ref name="MaherFeb27">{{cite news|url = http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Elections+Canada+investigating+robocalls+that+misled+voters/6194990/story.html|title = Elections Canada investigating 'robocalls' that misled voters|accessdate = March 18, 2012|last = Maher|first = Stephen and Glen McGregor|date = February 27, 2012| work = [[Ottawa Citizen]]}}</ref> While the Elections Canada investigation initially focused on calls sent into Guelph amidst nationwide complaints, the investigation has continued to expand in scope and continues to examine complaints in other ridings across the country.

On March 27, 2012 the [[Council of Canadians]] announced that they had launched a lawsuit in the [[Federal Court of Canada]] to ask for by-elections to be ordered in seven ridings where complaints were received and where Conservatives had won by slim margins. The ridings named are Don Valley East, Winnipeg South Centre, Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, Vancouver Island North, Yukon, Nipissing-Timiskaming and Elmwood-Transcona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/fp/yourmoney/Tories+offensive+over+robocalls/6234917/story.html |title=Tories go on offensive over robocalls |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Maher27Mar12">{{cite news|url = http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Robocalls+Activist+group+files+legal+challenge+results+seven+ridings/6362995/story.html|title = Robocalls: Activist group files legal challenge of results in seven ridings|accessdate = March 27, 2012|last = Maher|first = Stephen and Glen McGregor|date = March 27, 2012| work = [[Ottawa Citizen]]}}</ref> The case was heard over two weeks starting December 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Campion-Smith, Bruce|first=Wittington, Les|title=Elections Canada reveals massive robo-calls probe of 2011 election|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1296114--elections-canada-reveals-massive-robo-calls-probe-of-2011-election|accessdate=December 12, 2012|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=November 30, 2012}}</ref> Justice Richard G. Mosley ruled in May 2013 that fraud occurred in Guelph and that voting irregularities and misconduct occurred in all six of the contested ridings, but that it was not significant enough to warrant overturn the election results.

On March&nbsp;29, the [[Consortium#Coopetition|consortium of broadcasters]] playing host to the debates (the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], [[Télévision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]] and [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]]) announced that it would only invite the leaders of the four recognized parties in the House of Commons, namely, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic (NDP). Therefore the Green Party was [[Green Party of Canada#Exclusion from debates|excluded]], despite earning 6.8 per cent of the popular vote in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Burgmann |first=Tamsyn |title=Green's Elizabeth May will fight broadcasters' decision to ditch her from debate |newspaper=The Canadian Press |date=March 29, 2011 |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/breakingnews/greens-elizabeth-may-will-fight-broadcasters-decision-to-ditch-her-from-debate-118927234.html |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Debate over May diverts campaign Harper pushes lower corporate taxes, Layton would raise them, Ignatieff would add to CPP |newspaper=CBC News |date=March 30, 2011 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2011/03/30/cv-election.html |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Pynn |first=Larry |last2=Minsky |first2=Amy |title=Greens' Elizabeth May, determined to enter debate, prepares legal action|newspaper=Vancouver Sun and Postmedia News |date=March 30, 2011 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Greens+Elizabeth+determined+enter+debate+prepares+legal+action/4529114/story.html |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Leblanc |first=Daniel |title=Elizabeth May excluded from election debates |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/elizabeth-may-excluded-from-election-debates/article1962085/ |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

On March&nbsp;30, Stephen Harper challenged Michael Ignatieff to a one-on-one televised debate.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Steven |last1=Chase |coauthors=Gloria Galloway and Jane Taber |title=Harper and Ignatieff game for head-to-head debate |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/harper-and-ignatieff-game-for-head-to-head-debate/article1963435/ |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=March 30, 2011}}</ref> Although Ignatieff accepted the challenge, this was opposed by the other opposition parties. The idea was later rejected by the broadcast consortium and cancelled.

On April&nbsp;1, comedian [[Rick Mercer]] suggested over Twitter hosting a one-on-one debate between Stephen Harper and Michael Ignatieff at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]]. He later added he would donate $50,000 to the charities of their choosing if they were willing to participate. Ignatieff immediately accepted the challenge and named the [[Alzheimer Society of Canada|Alzheimer Society]] as his charity of choice, as his mother succumbed to Alzheimer's disease in 1992. Harper did not respond to the challenge.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ignatieff accepts Rick Mercer debate offer |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/offbeat/story/2011/04/02/mercer-ignatieff-harper-cv-election.html |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |date=April 2, 2011 |agency=CBC |work=CBC News}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' published on April&nbsp;1, Troy Reeb, the [[Consortium#Coopetition|broadcast consortium]] chairman, discussed the process behind setting up the leaders' debates and the rationale for various decisions made, including the decision to exclude the Green Party's leader Elizabeth May.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ladurantaye |first=Steve |title=Why the TV consortium excluded Elizabeth May |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-the-tv-consortium-excluded-elizabeth-may/article1966583/ |accessdate=April 5, 2011 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=April 1, 2011}}</ref>

On April&nbsp;5, the Federal Court rejected the Green Party's request for an expedited hearing on the matter prior to the scheduled debates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge denies Elizabeth May’s bid to join leaders' debates |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/judge-denies-elizabeth-mays-bid-to-join-leaders-debates/article1971474/ |accessdate=April 5, 2011 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=April 5, 2011 |agency=CP}}</ref>

On April&nbsp;10, the date of the French leaders debate was changed from April&nbsp;14 to April&nbsp;13 due to worries of broadcasting conflicts with the [[2011 NHL playoffs|NHL playoffs]] scheduled for April&nbsp;14.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Canadian: NHL trumps debate date |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/04/10/cv-election-debats-duceppe.html |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |date=April 10, 2011 |agency=CBC |work=CBC News}}</ref> Also on April&nbsp;10, Elizabeth May participated in a panel interview on [[CHCH-TV]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], which she was invited to attend, as were the leaders of the Bloc, Liberals, New Democrats and Conservatives, by [[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]], whose president was disappointed by May's exclusion from the leaders' debates.<ref>{{cite news |title=CHCH-TV to Broadcast "Elizabeth May, For the Record" Live this Sunday, April&nbsp;10, 2011 – 8pm&nbsp;ET |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2011/08/c2709.html |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |publisher=CNW Group |date=April 8, 2011 |agency=CNW}}</ref>

===Small parties public forum===
A joint press conference and public forum was staged by 11 of the 18 registered parties and one unregistered party on April 23, 2011, at [[York University]].  Forum organizers invited the leaders from all registered political parties who do not have seats in parliament.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anna Di Carlo |url=http://www.cpcml.ca/Tmld2011/D41062.htm |title=The Marxist-Leninist Daily |publisher=Cpcml.ca |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> Parties were able to explain their platforms and responded to questions from the audience.  As a forum, the goal was an inter-party discussion of major issues, however some debate did occur.

Participants in the forum were the [[Animal Alliance Environment Voters Party of Canada|Animal Alliance Environmental Voters]], the [[Canadian Action Party]], the [[Christian Heritage Party of Canada|Christian Heritage Party]], the [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist Party]], the [[First Peoples National Party of Canada|First Peoples National]], the [[Libertarian Party of Canada|Libertarian Party]], the [[Marijuana Party of Canada|Marijuana Party]], the [[Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist)|Marxist–Leninist Party]], the [[Rhinoceros Party]], and the [[Pirate Party of Canada|Pirate Party]].

Green Party Leader [[Elizabeth May]] refused to participate in the forum claiming they are not one of "the small, fringe parties."<ref name=fringedebate>{{cite news|title=Green Party snubs fringe debate|work=National Post |location=Canada |author=Adrian Humphreys |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/04/05/green-party-snubs-fringe-debate/|date=April 5, 2011}}</ref>

===New Democratic Party surge===
In the week before the leaders debate, on April&nbsp;8, a poll showed the New Democratic Party (NDP) support at 13.2%.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Richard J.

The surge began in Quebec, with the NDP surprising many observers by surpassing the previously front-running Bloc in Quebec. In the entirety of Canada, the NDP surged past the Liberals to take the second place behind the Conservatives; in Quebec, the NDP took first place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/25/canada-us-politics-ekos-idCATRE73O5UR20110425 |title=NDP surges to strong second place in poll |publisher=Reuters |date=April 25, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |first=Janet |last=Guttsman}}</ref><ref name="EKOS">{{cite web|url = http://www.ekospolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/full_report_april_21_2011.pdf|title = NDP Breakout Continues As Everyone Else Spins Wheels|accessdate =April 23, 2011|last = [[EKOS]]|date=April 2011}}</ref> The NDP surge became the dominant narrative of the last week of the campaign, as other parties turned their attacks on the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/decision-canada/surge+dominates+talk+federal+campaign+trail/4685960/story.html |title=NDP surge dominates talk on federal campaign trail |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada |date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Ruth Ellen Brosseau]], the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]] candidate in [[Berthier—Maskinongé]], won despite not running a campaign and having a holiday in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].<ref name=StarResultsPostElection/> The NDP's rise in popularity was nicknamed "Orange Crush", an allusion to [[Orange Crush|the soft drink with the same name]] and the party's colour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2011/08/remembering-jack-layton.html|title=Remembering Jack Layton|publisher=[[CBC News]]|first=Laura|last=Payton|quote=The NDP's surging popularity, especially in Quebec, during the last election came to be known as the Orange Crush.|date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

==Spending limits==

The calculation for a party's spending limit is based on the number of candidates a party is running and the number of voters in each riding where there is a candidate.<ref name="Spendinglimits">{{cite news|title=Elections Canada sets campaign spending limits|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/decision-canada/Elections+Canada+sets+campaign+spending+limits/4672522/story.html|accessdate=May 11, 2011|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=April 25, 2011}}</ref> Parties are allowed to spend 70 cents for each one of those voters.<ref name="Spendinglimits"/> Local candidates were allowed to spend $2.07 for each of the first 15,000 electors, $1.04 for each of the next 10,000 and 52 cents for the remaining electors.<ref name="Spendinglimits"/>
