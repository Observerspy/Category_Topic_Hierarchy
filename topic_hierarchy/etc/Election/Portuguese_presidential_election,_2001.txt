The '''Portuguese presidential election of 2001''' was held on '''14 January'''.

The victory of incumbent president [[Jorge Branco de Sampaio]] was never in doubt and the turnout was therefore quite low (49.71%). Again, the incumbent president was reelected, like what happened with [[Mário Soares]] and [[Ramalho Eanes]]. 

As the election of a center-left president was almost certain, both the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] and the [[Left Bloc]], this last for the first time, presented their own candidates, as their support against the right wing candidate was not necessary. The [[Communist Party of the Portuguese Workers]] also presented its own candidate for the first time in its history, [[Garcia Pereira]].

On the right, [[Joaquim Martins Ferreira do Amaral|Ferreira do Amaral]] was supported by the two major parties, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[People's Party (Portugal)|People's Party]] which, again, could not achieve their old objective of electing a right-wing president for the first time since the [[Carnation Revolution]].

There were also four candidates rejected by the [[Portuguese Constitutional Court]] for not complying with the legal requirement of being proposed by 7500 voters:
* Pedro Maria Braga
* Maria Teresa Lameiro
* Josué Rodrigues Pedro 
* Manuel João Vieira 

These four candidates were present in the draw of the ballot position, but did not appear in the final ballot.

It was the first time Portuguese abroad could vote for the presidency.

==Candidates==
*'''[[Jorge Sampaio]]''', President since 1996, leader of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]] between 1989 and 1992, supported by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]];
*'''[[Joaquim Martins Ferreira do Amaral]]''', former minister of public works of Cavaco Silva government between 1990 and 1995, supported by the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] and by the [[People's Party (Portugal)|People's Party]];
*'''[[António Simões de Abreu]]''', alderman in Lisbon between 1997 and 2001, supported by the [[Portuguese Communist Party]];
*'''[[Fernando Rosas]]''', Portuguese academic and politician, supported by the [[Left Bloc]];
*'''[[Garcia Pereira]]''', Secretary-General of the [[PCTP/MRPP]];
