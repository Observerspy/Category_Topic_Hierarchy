A presidential election was held in the '''[[Republic of Georgia]]''' on January 4, 2004. The election followed the resignation of former President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. As expected, the main opposition leader, [[Mikhail Saakashvili]], was soon shown by exit polls to be heading for an overwhelming victory. According to preliminary results issued on January 6 by Georgia's Central Election Commission, Saakashvili won over 97% of the votes cast.

The other candidates received less than 2% each. They were former presidential envoy to the [[Imereti]] region [[Temur Shashiashvili]], leader of the Lawyers of Georgia Party [[Kartlos Garibashvili]], one of the leaders of the political organization ''Mdzleveli'', [[Zurab Kelekhsashvili]], the President of the Coalition of [[NGO|Non-Government Organisations]] of the Disabled [[Zaza Sikharulidze]], and leader of the ''[[David Agmashenebeli]] Party'' [[Roin Liparteliani]].

Georgian law requires a 50% turnout for elections to be valid. The Chairman of the Georgian Central Election Commission, [[Zurab Tchiaberashvili]], said that since about 1,763,000 voters had participated - over 80% of those eligible to vote - "according to the preliminary information, the elections are valid." 

Early on January 5 Saakashvili claimed victory, although no official figures had been released at that time. He thanked his supporters, who were gathered in the Philharmonic Hall in [[Tbilisi]], and also thanked the voters. "The whole of Georgia has won," he said.

"The primary tasks to be implemented from the first days of my presidency include introduction of a Prime Minister's post, appointment of a date for parliamentary elections and implementation of anti-corruption measures in the country," Saakashvili said.

Saakashvili was inaugurated as President in [[Tbilisi]] on January 25, 2004.
