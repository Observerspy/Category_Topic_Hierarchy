The '''United Kingdom general election of 2010''' was held on Thursday 6 May 2010, with 45,597,461 registered voters<ref name=ElecComm/> entitled to vote to elect members to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The [[Elections in the United Kingdom|election]] took place in [[United Kingdom constituencies|650 constituencies]]<ref name="thirsk" group="note" /> across the United Kingdom under the [[first-past-the-post]] system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats needed for an overall majority. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[David Cameron]], won the largest number of votes and seats but still fell twenty seats short. This resulted in a [[hung parliament]] where no party was able to command a majority in the House of Commons. This was only the second general election since World War II to return a hung parliament, the first being the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 election]]. Unlike in 1974, the potential for a hung parliament had this time been widely considered and predicted and both the country and politicians were better prepared for the constitutional process that would follow such a result.<ref name="timesonline1">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7119226.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797084|title=Britain wakes up to a hung Parliament|date=7 May 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=7 May 2010|first1=Philippe|last1=Naughton|first2=Roland|last2=Watson | location=London}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010–present)|coalition government]] that was subsequently formed was the first coalition in British history to eventuate directly from an election outcome.

There was an aborted attempt to put together a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]/Liberal Democrat coalition (although other smaller parties would have been required to make up the ten seats they lacked for a majority). To facilitate this [[Gordon Brown]] announced on the evening of Monday 10 May that he would resign as Labour Party leader.

None of the three main party leaders had previously led a general election campaign, a situation which had not occurred since [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|the 1979 election]]. During the campaign, the three main party leaders engaged in a series of [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010|televised debates]], the first such debates in a British general election campaign. The Liberal Democrats achieved a breakthrough in opinion polls after the first debate in which their leader [[Nick Clegg]] was widely seen as the strongest performer. On polling day their share of the vote increased by only 1% over the previous general election, and they suffered a net loss of five seats. This was still the Liberal Democrats' largest popular vote since the party's creation, and they found themselves in a pivotal role in the formation of the new government. The share of votes for parties other than Labour or the Conservatives was 35% and was the largest since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]]. In terms of votes it was the most "three-cornered" election since [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923]], and in terms of seats since [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929]]. The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] won its first ever seat in the Commons, and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] also gained its first elected member.<ref>In 1973 Stratton Mills, elected as a Unionist, defected to the Alliance Party but retired from Westminster at the next general election.</ref> The result in one constituency, [[Oldham East and Saddleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham East and Saddleworth]], was subsequently declared void on petition because of [[Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election, 2011|illegal practices during the campaign]], the first such instance since 1910.

== Background ==
The Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]], went to [[Buckingham Palace]] on 6 April and asked the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] to [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolve Parliament]] on 12 April, confirming in a live press conference in [[Downing Street]], as had long been speculated, that the election would be held on 6 May,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8603591.stm |title=Gordon Brown calls 6 May general election |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2010}}</ref> five years since the previous election on 5 May 2005. The election took place on 6 May in [[Constituencies in the United Kingdom general election, 2010|649 constituencies]] across the United Kingdom, under the [[first-past-the-post]] system, for seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Voting in the [[Thirsk and Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Thirsk and Malton constituency]]<ref name="thirsk" group="note" /> was postponed for three weeks because of the [[List of deaths of candidates during general elections of the United Kingdom|death of a candidate]].

The governing Labour Party had campaigned to secure a fourth consecutive term in office and to restore support lost since 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6236315.stm|title=Brown would 'renew' Labour Party|publisher=BBC News|date=5 January 2007}}</ref> The Conservative Party sought to gain a dominant position in British politics after losses in the 1990s, and to replace Labour as the governing party. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both sides and hoped to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in a hung parliament. Since the [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010|televised debates]] between the three leaders, their poll ratings had risen to the point where many considered the possibility of a Liberal Democrat role in Government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8628765.stm|title=Election 2010: Lib Dem policies targeted by rivals|publisher=BBC News|date=19 April 2010}}</ref> Polls just before election day saw a slight swing from the Liberal Democrats back to Labour and Conservatives, with the majority of final polls falling within one point of Conservatives 36%, Labour 29%, Liberal Democrats 23%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/2688 |title=Final poll of the campaign |first=Anthony |last=Wells |publisher=UK Polling Report |date=6 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7117623.ece |title=Tories scent victory as poll lead widens  |work=The Times|date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010| first1=Peter | last1=Riddell | first2=Jill | last2=Sherman | first3=Roland | last3=Watson | location=London}}</ref> However, record numbers of undecided voters raised uncertainty about the outcome.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/51d39a34-57dd-11df-855b-00144feab49a.html|title=UK – Brown woos undecided voters|work=Financial Times|date=5 May 2010|last=Pickard|first=Jim|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a9eRFBXAs_Co&pos=9|title=Brown Placing Third May Win Most Seats as Undecided Hold Key|publisher=Bloomberg|date=27 April 2010|last1=Jefferson|first1= Rodney|last2=Hutton|first2=Robert|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> The [[Scottish National Party]], encouraged by their victory in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish parliament elections]], set itself a target of 20 MPs and was hoping to find itself holding a balance of power.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Salmond-wants-Westminster-to-39dance.4001458.jp |title=Salmond wants Westminster to 'dance to a Scottish jig' as he targets 20 seats |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=21 April 2008 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> Equally, [[Plaid Cymru]] sought gains in Wales. Smaller parties which had had successes at local elections and the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European elections]] ([[UK Independence Party]], Green Party, [[British National Party]]) looked to extend their representation to seats in the House of Commons. The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] looked to maintain, if not extend, its number of seats, having been the fourth largest party in the House of Commons.

=== MPs declining re-election ===
{{Main|List of MPs who stood down at the United Kingdom general election, 2010}}

This election had an unusually high number of MPs choosing not to seek re-election with more standing down than did so at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] (which on account of the extraordinary [[Second World War|wartime]] circumstances came ten years after the preceding election).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/michaelcrick/2009/12/a_postwar_record_for_mps_stand.html|title=A post-war record for MPs standing down|publisher=BBC News|date=2 December 2009}}</ref> This has been attributed to the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 expenses scandal]] and the fact that redundancy-style payments for departing MPs may be scrapped after the election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/6894889/Quarter-of-MPs-to-stand-down-over-expenses.html|title=Quarter of MPs to stand down over expenses|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 December 2009|first1=Robert|last1=Winnett|first2=Rosa|last2=Prince|accessdate=26 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

In all, 148 MPs (100 Labour, 35 Conservatives, 7 Liberal Democrats, 2 Independents, 1 Independent Conservative and 1 member each from Plaid Cymru, the DUP, and the SDLP) decided not to contest the election. [[Alex Salmond]] did not stand for re-election in order to focus on the role of [[First Minister of Scotland]] but the SNP retained the seat with a different candidate and a reduced majority over the Conservative Party.

=== Boundary changes ===
{{Main|Boundary changes for the United Kingdom general election, 2010|Constituencies in the United Kingdom general election, 2010}}
[[File:2005UKElectionNominalMap.svg|240px|thumb|The notional (i.e. hypothetical) <!-- sic. Yes, it is "notional". Not "national"--> results of the 2005 election, if they had taken place with the new boundaries]]

Each of the four national [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]]s is required by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 (as amended by the Boundary Commissions Act 1992) to conduct a general review of all the constituencies in its part of the United Kingdom every eight to twelve years to ensure the size and composition of constituencies are as fair as possible. Based on the Rallings and Thrasher studies using ward by ward data from local elections and the 2005 general election, the new boundaries used in 2010 would have returned nine fewer Labour MPs had they been in place at the previous election; given that there are to be four more seats in the next parliament this nationally reduces Labour's majority from 66 to 48.<ref name="Media Guide">Colin Rallings, Michael Thrasher, "The Media Guide to the New Parliamentary Constituencies", Local Government Chronicle Elections Centre, 2007, ISBN 0-948858-45-1</ref>

Pursuant to Boundary Commission for England recommendations, the number of seats in England increased by four, and numerous changes were made to the existing constituency boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/20071681.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007 (S.I. 2007 No. 1681)|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|date=13 June 2007}}</ref>

Northern Ireland continued to elect 18 MPs, but minor changes were made to the eastern constituencies in accordance with the Northern Ireland Boundary Commission's recommendations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20081486_en_1|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008 No. 1486)|date=11 June 2006|publisher=The National Archives}}</ref> For the first time, these changes include the splitting of an [[ward (country subdivision)|electoral ward]] between two constituencies.

Following the recommendations of the Boundary Commission for Wales, the total number of seats remained at 40, although new seats caused by radical redrawing of boundaries in [[Clwyd]] and [[Gwynedd]] were fought for the first time: [[Arfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Arfon]] and [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (UK Parliament constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]] replaced [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]] and [[Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Meirionnydd Nant Conwy]] respectively; [[Aberconwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberconwy]] replaced [[Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Conwy]]. At the time of the election Welsh constituencies had electorates on average around 14,000 smaller than their counterparts in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20061041.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 1041)|date=11 June 2006|publisher=The National Archives}}</ref>

Scotland saw its most recent large-scale review completed in 2004, so its 59 constituencies remained the same as at the 2005 general election.

=== Main parties ===
{{See also|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|Liberal Democrats leadership election, 2006|Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|Liberal Democrats leadership election, 2007}}
All three main parties went into the general election having changed leaders since 2005. [[David Cameron]] became [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader in December 2005, replacing [[Michael Howard]]. [[Gordon Brown]] succeeded [[Tony Blair]] as leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and Prime Minister in June 2007. [[Nick Clegg]] was elected as leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]] in December 2007, succeeding [[Menzies Campbell]] who had replaced [[Charles Kennedy]] in January 2006. The last time all three main parties went into a general election with new leaders was in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 election]], when [[James Callaghan]] as Labour leader, [[Margaret Thatcher]] for the Conservatives, and [[David Steel]] with the then-[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] took to the polls.

The prospect of a [[coalition government|coalition]] or [[minority government]] was being considered well before polling day.

In 2009, [[Nigel Farage]] announced his intention to resign as UKIP leader to focus on becoming an MP. Farage was replaced in an election by party members by [[Malcolm Pearson, Baron Pearson of Rannoch|Lord Pearson of Rannoch]], whose stated intention was for the electoral support of UKIP to force a hung parliament. The Green Party of England and Wales voted to have a position of leader for the first time; the [[Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2008|first leadership election]] was won by [[Caroline Lucas]], who successfully contested the constituency of [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]].

In addition, a new loose coalition, [[Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition]] (TUSC), contested a general election for the first time. TUSC was a grouping of left wing parties that participated in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament elections]] under the name of [[No2EU]]; members included the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]], the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]], [[Socialist Resistance]], and is supported by some members of [[UNISON]], the [[National Union of Teachers]], the [[University and College Union]], the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]], and the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]].

====Bigotgate====
[[Gordon Brown]], while in his car on 28 April, privately described a 65-year-old woman and lifelong Labour voter, Gillian Duffy, from [[Rochdale]], [[Greater Manchester]], a Labour-Liberal Democrat marginal seat, as a "bigoted woman". She had asked him about vulnerable people supposedly not receiving benefits because non-vulnerable people were receiving them, adding, "You can't say anything about the immigrants because you're saying that you're&nbsp;... but all these eastern Europeans what are coming in, where are they flocking from?" He replied "A million people have come from Europe but a million British people have gone into Europe."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8649476.stm |title=Profile of Gillian Duffy, the voter PM called 'bigoted' |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8649448.stm |title=How Gordon Brown 'bigot' jibe row unfolded |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> Brown's conversation with his communications director Justin Forsyth (JF) went:

The SNP attempted but failed to ban the broadcast of the final party leaders debate in Scotland, in a court action. They had argued that "the corporation [the BBC] had breached its rules on impartiality by excluding the SNP." The judge, Lady Smith, ruled that "the SNP's case 'lacks the requisite precision and clarity'" and added she could not "conclude the BBC had breached impartiality rules." Additionally, broadcasting regulator Ofcom ruled that it had not "upheld complaints received from the SNP and Plaid Cymru about The First Election Debate broadcast on ITV1 on Thursday 15 April 2010."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/scotland/8648425.stm|title=SNP fails in BBC debate court bid|date=28 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref>

== Opinion polls ==
[[File:Polling station on Aire Road in Wetherby, West Yorkshire (6th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|A polling station in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]
{{Main|Opinion polling for the United Kingdom general election, 2010}}
{{See also|Exit poll|Opinion poll}}

Since each MP is elected separately by the [[first past the post]] voting system, it is impossible to precisely project a clear election outcome from overall UK shares of the vote. Not only can individual constituencies vary markedly from overall voting trends, but individual countries and regions within the UK may have a very different electoral contest that is not properly reflected in overall share of the vote figures.

Immediately following the previous general election, the Labour party held a double-digit lead in opinion polls. However, over the course of 2005, this lead was eroded somewhat. By December 2005, the Conservative party showed its first small leads in opinion polls following the controversial [[Terrorism Act 2006#Extending the period of detention without charge|90 days detention]] proposals and the election of [[David Cameron]] to the leadership of the Conservative party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/104 |title=Tories take the Lead |date=10 December 2005 |author=Wells, Anthony |publisher=UKPollingReport |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>

In early 2006, opinion polls were increasingly mixed with small leads given alternately to Labour and Conservative. From the May 2006 local elections, in which Labour suffered significant losses, the Conservatives took a small single-digit lead in opinion polls. Labour regained the lead in June 2007 following the resignation of [[Tony Blair]] and the appointment of [[Gordon Brown]] as prime minister. From November 2007, the Conservatives again took the lead and, from then, extended their lead into double digits, particularly in response to the MPs' expenses scandal, although there was some evidence that the lead narrowed slightly towards the end of 2009. By the end of February 2010, [[Ipsos MORI]], [[ICM Research|ICM]], [[YouGov]] and [[ComRes]] polls had all found a sufficient narrowing of the Conservative lead for media speculation about a hung parliament to return.<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/2436 YouGov show Tory lead cut to 7 points] UK Polling Report, 29 January 2010</ref>

From 15 April 2010, following the first televised debate of the party leaders, polling data changed dramatically, with the Lib Dem vote proportion rising to 28–33%, and the Conservative vote proportion falling. In some polls, the Liberal Democrats took the lead from the Conservatives. Under UNS projections, this made a hung parliament highly probable, if Lib Dem performance had persisted.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/20/general-election-2010-poll-editorial General election 2010: All change for new politics] ''The Guardian'', 20 April 2010</ref>

The following graph shows ComRes poll results recorded over the period 11 April – 6 May 2010, including annotations of the three TV debates:

[[File:ComRes Graph Election 2010.JPG]]

After the second debate on 22 April the polls, on average, placed the Conservatives in the lead on 33%, the Liberal Democrats in second on 30% and Labour in third on 28%. If these polls had reflected the election day results on a uniform swing nationwide, Labour would have had the most seats in a hung Parliament.

=== Exit poll ===
At 22:00 on election day, coinciding with the closure of the polls, the results of an [[exit poll]] completed by GfK NOP and Ipsos MORI on behalf of the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Sky News|Sky]] and [[ITV News|ITV]] news services was announced. Data were gathered from individuals at 130 polling stations around the country. The results of the poll initially suggested a hung parliament with the Conservative Party 19 seats from a controlling majority; this was later adjusted to 21 seats. The distribution of seats amongst the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and other parties was initially suggested to be 307, 255, 59 and 29 respectively,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8666227.stm |title=Election exit poll: Tories to be 19 short of majority |date=6 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> although the seat numbers were later changed to 303, 251, 69, and 27 respectively.<ref name=BBCLive>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/liveevent/|title=Live coverage – General Election 2010|publisher=BBC News|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>

Initial reaction to the exit poll by various commentators was of surprise at the apparent poor prospects for the Liberal Democrats<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8666266.stm |title=Parties surprised by exit poll |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> because it was odds with many opinion polls undertaken in the previous weeks. The actual results showed that the exit poll was a good predictor.

A later BBC Exit poll (05:36 BST) predicted the Conservatives on 306, 20 short of an overall majority, Labour on 262, and Liberal Democrats on 55.<ref name=BBCLive/>

=== Election petitions ===

Two results were also challenged by defeated candidates through election petitions – [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]], and [[Oldham East and Saddleworth]].

==== Fermanagh and South Tyrone ====
The defeated Unionist 'Unity' candidate, Rodney Connor, lodged a petition against the successful Sinn Féin candidate, [[Michelle Gildernew]], in [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]], alleging irregularities in the counting of the votes had affected the result. Gildernew had won with a plurality of four votes. However the Court found that there were only three ballot papers which could not be accounted for, and even if they were all votes for Connor, Gildernew would have had a plurality of one. The election was therefore upheld.<ref name=Unionist_dismay>{{cite news|title=Unionist dismay as election case falters|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/unionist-dismay-as-election-case-falters-1-1867964|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=News Letter|date=23 October 2010}}</ref>

==== Oldham East and Saddleworth ====
{{see also|Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election, 2011}}
On 28 May 2010, the defeated Liberal Democrat candidate Elwyn Watkins lodged a petition against the election of Phil Woolas (Labour) in [[Oldham East and Saddleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham East and Saddleworth]] constituency.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/10181693.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Candidate challenges Woolas win | date=28 May 2010}}</ref> The petition challenged leaflets issued by Woolas' campaign as having contained false statements of fact concerning Watkins' personal character, which is an illegal practice under section 106 of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]].

During the court case a number of emails between Woolas and his campaign team emerged.

At 9:41 on 7 May, the BBC confirmed a [[hung parliament]]. The Conservatives stood at 290 seats, Labour at 247 and Liberal Democrats at 51.<ref name="timesonline1"/><ref name = "BBC-Election-2010-web">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/| publisher=BBC News | title = Election 2010 | date = 7 May 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010 }}</ref> One constituency seat ([[Thirsk and Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Thirsk and Malton]]) was contested on 27 May because of the death of the UKIP candidate and was won by the Conservative party, whilst another seat ([[Oldham East and Saddleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham East and Saddleworth]]) later had its result declared void; Labour won the resulting [[Oldham East and Saddleworth United Kingdom general election 2010 rerun|by-election]].

[[File:Chartinguk20100506electionvotesandseats.png|thumb|right|200px|alt=pie chart of the election results showing popular vote against seats won, coloured in party colours|Proportion of seats (outer ring) shown with proportion of votes (inner ring).]]

The result showed an overall 5% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, nearly similar to the 5.2% swing achieved by the Conservative leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979.<ref name="BBC-Election-2010-web"/> The 97 net seat gains made by the Conservatives outdid their previous best gains total in [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]], when they gained 85. Labour's loss of 91 seats was worse than their previous greatest loss of seats, when they lost 77 seats in [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]].

Of the 532 seats contested in England (a final seat, Thirsk and Malton, was contested on 27 May), the Conservatives won 298 seats and an absolute majority of 61 seats over all other parties combined, securing an average swing of 5.6% from Labour.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/region/48.stm |title= Election 2010: England |publisher=BBC News|date= 7 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> Labour did poorly in many Southern areas, notably in the Eastern Region where they won only two of their 14 seats from 2005: [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]] and [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]]. The Labour party did however gain two seats: [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]] and [[Chesterfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterfield]]. The Conservatives made 95 of their gains in England, but they also suffered three losses, all to the Liberal Democrats. For the Liberal Democrats, their eight gains were overshadowed by their 12 losses – one to Labour and 11 to the Conservatives.

None of Scotland's 59 seats changed hands and all were held by the same party that had won them at the 2005 election, with Labour regaining the two seats they had lost in by-elections since 2005. There was a swing to Labour from the Conservatives of 0.8% (with Labour increasing its share of the vote by 2.5% and the Conservatives increasing by just 0.9%) The Conservatives finished with just a single MP representing a Scottish constituency.

Of the 40 seats contested in Wales, the Conservatives more than doubled their seats from three to eight, taking one from the Liberal Democrats and four from Labour. [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh nationalist]] party [[Plaid Cymru]]'s number of seats was reduced from three to two on the new seat boundaries, but they managed to gain one seat, [[Arfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Arfon]], from Labour. Labour did however regain [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]], which had once been Labour's safest seat in Wales until it had been taken by an Independent, [[Peter Law]], in 2005.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/wales/4514385.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Labour loses safest seat in Wales | date=6 May 2005}}</ref> Overall, Labour made a net loss of 4 seats but remained the biggest party, with 26.

There were 18 seats contested in [[Northern Ireland]]. Both [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] parties, [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), held their seats. The [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) and [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) (the latter in [[UCUNF|an electoral pact with the Conservatives]]), lost one seat each. This left the nationalist parties unchanged with eight seats, the main unionist parties with eight seats (all DUP), the Alliance with one seat and an independent unionist with one seat. It is the first time since the [[partition of Ireland]] that unionist parties failed to secure a majority of Northern Ireland's Westminster seats in a general election, and also the first time Sinn Féin obtained the largest share of the vote in Northern Ireland at a general election.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fw10.htm|title=2010 Westminster Elections|work=Access Research Knowledge|publisher=Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive (ARK)|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Demographics ===
The election resulted in an increase in the number of MPs from ethnic minorities from 14 to 27, including the first black and Asian female Conservative MPs, [[Helen Grant (politician)|Helen Grant]] and [[Priti Patel]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/07/black-minority-ethnic-mps-2010 |title=UK Election results: Number of minority ethnic MPs almost doubles |work=The Guardian |date=7 May 2010 | first=Afua | last=Hirsch | location=London}}</ref> and the first female Muslim MPs, [[Rushanara Ali]], [[Shabana Mahmood]] and [[Yasmin Qureshi]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/nations-first-female-muslim-mps-rejoice-20100508-ukxf.html |title=Nation's first female Muslim MPs rejoice |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 May 2010}}</ref> This means that 4.2% of MPs are from an ethnic minority – in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], it was reported that [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|ethnic minorities]] comprised 7.9% of the population. The number of female MPs rose to 141, an increase from 19.5% to 21.7% of all MPs, and the highest ever total; the number of female Conservative MPs rose from 18 (8.6% of all Conservatives) to 48 (15.7%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/news/female-representation-in-government-increases-slightly-news-19770799 |title=Female representation in government increases slightly |publisher=Women in technology |date=11 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Northern Ireland ===
{{main|2010 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland}}
In Northern Ireland a swing of more than 20% resulted in DUP [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]] [[Peter Robinson (politician)|Peter Robinson]] losing his [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/701.stm|title=Election 2010 – Belfast East|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> seat to the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]'s [[Naomi Long]], giving Alliance its first elected MP in Westminster.

[[Reg Empey|Sir Reg Empey]], leader of the UUP/Conservative alliance (UCUNF), standing for the first time in [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]], lost to the DUP incumbent [[William McCrea (politician)|William McCrea]]. Thus both leaders of the main Unionist parties failed to win seats while the UUP for the first time has no MPs at Westminster. A few days after the election, Empey announced that he would resign before the party conference, triggering a [[Ulster Unionist Party leadership election, 2010|leadership election]].

[[Sylvia Hermon|Sylvia Hermon, Lady Hermon]] retained her seat in [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], significantly increasing her percentage of the vote despite a slightly lower turnout and her defection from the UUP/Conservative alliance to stand as an independent.

New SDLP leader [[Margaret Ritchie (politician)|Margaret Ritchie]], succeeding [[Eddie McGrady]] MP, won against Sinn Féin's Caitriona Ruane in [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down]]. All of the Sinn Féin and SDLP incumbents held their seats, although Sinn Féin's [[Michelle Gildernew]] retained her seat in [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh & South Tyrone]] by only four votes over the Independent Unionist Unity candidate, [[Rodney Connor]], after three recounts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/northern_ireland/8667134.stm|title=SF's Gildernew retains her seat|publisher=BBC News|date=7 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>

== Effect of the expenses scandal ==

Many of the MPs who were most prominently caught up in the scandal decided, or were ordered, not to stand for re-election in 2010.

Where sitting MPs did stand for re-election after their expenses claims were criticised, there were some notable losses. Former Home Secretary [[Jacqui Smith]] lost her marginal [[Redditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Redditch]] seat, which showed a large 9.2% swing to the Conservatives. Smith had claimed expenses on a large family home in Redditch by declaring her house-share with her sister in London as her main home, had been described as "near fraudulent" by the former chairman of the committee on Standards in Public life,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/10/mps-expenses-jacqui-smith |title=Taxmen to probe MPs over profits from home sales |work=The Guardian |date=10 May 2009 | first1=Rajeev | last1=Syal | first2=Toby | last2=Helm | first3=Gaby | last3=Hinsliff | location=London}}</ref> although she had only been ordered to apologise rather than repay the money.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/12/smith-expenses-breach |title=Jacqui Smith apologises to MPs for misusing second home allowance |work=The Guardian |date=12 October 2009 |last=Sparrow |first=Andrew | location=London}}</ref> Former Home Office minister [[Tony McNulty]] lost [[Harrow East (UK Parliament constituency)|Harrow East]] to the Conservatives on an 8% swing, after repaying over £13,000 claimed on a second home, occupied by his parents, which was 8 miles away from his primary residence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7957555.stm |title=McNulty defends expenses claims |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2009}}</ref> [[Ann Keen]] lost [[Brentford and Isleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentford and Isleworth]] on a 6% swing, but her husband [[Alan Keen]] retained [[Feltham and Heston]].

Independents supported by the [[Jury Team]] or the [[Independent Network]], support networks who both attempted to select and promote high quality Independents who had signed up for the so-called Nolan Principles of public life, set out in the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]], failed to have any significant impact. Broadcaster [[Esther Rantzen]] gathered a great deal of publicity for her campaign in [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South constituency]] where the former MP Margaret Moran had stood down, but ended up losing her deposit in 4th place with 4.4% of the vote; the winner was Moran's successor as Labour candidate.

There was also a high profile campaign over expenses directed against [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] [[John Bercow]], who had 'flipped' his designation of second home. An imperfectly observed convention states that the major parties do not oppose the Speaker seeking re-election; Bercow faced two main opponents in  [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]]. Independent former Member of the European Parliament [[John Stevens (politician)|John Stevens]], standing on the Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy ticket, campaigned with a man dressed in a dolphin costume whom he called 'Flipper'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/04/john-bercow-speaker-buckingham |title=Bercow's last stand? |last=Seddon |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Seddon |work=New Statesman |date=21 April 2010}}</ref> and polled second with 21.4%. Former leader of the [[UK Independence Party]] [[Nigel Farage]] also fought the seat but came third in the vote with 17.4%. Bercow won with 47.3%.

When it became clear that no party would achieve an overall majority the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for forming the next government with the other parties.

On 11 May 2010, as coalition talks between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats seemed to be drawing to a successful conclusion,<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> [[Gordon Brown]] announced that he was resigning as Prime Minister and also as Labour leader. He then left [[Downing Street]], accompanied by his wife and children, driving to [[Buckingham Palace]] where he tendered his resignation to Her Majesty the Queen and advised her to call for [[David Cameron]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/liveevent/|title=Election 2010 – Live coverage – General Election 2010|publisher=BBC News|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8676273.stm|title=PM's full resignation statement|publisher=BBC News|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Premiership of David Cameron|Cameron became Prime Minister]] one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation.<ref name=CamPMBBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8675265.stm|title=David Cameron is UK's new prime minister|date=11 May 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> In his first address outside [[10 Downing Street]], he announced his intention to [[Cameron ministry|form a coalition government]], the first since the Second World War, with the [[Liberal Democrats]].
