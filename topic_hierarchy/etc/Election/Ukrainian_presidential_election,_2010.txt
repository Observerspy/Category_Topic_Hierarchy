==Background==
In Ukraine, the previous two presidential first round ballots have traditionally occurred in October.

According to the [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 103|Constitution of Ukraine]], regular elections of the President of Ukraine are held on the last Sunday of the last month of the fifth year of the term of authority of the President of Ukraine. In the event of pre-term termination of authority of the President of Ukraine, elections of the President of Ukraine are held within ninety days from the day of termination of the authority.

Early Presidential elections can be held in case of presidential resignation, ill-health, [[impeachment]] or death.

The President of Ukraine is elected by the citizens of Ukraine for a five-year term, on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage, by secret ballot.

A candidate seeking election must be a citizen of Ukraine who has attained the age of thirty-five, has the right to vote, has resided in Ukraine for the past ten years prior to the day of elections, and has command of the state language as required by [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 103|Article 103 of Ukraine's Constitution]].

On April 1, 2009, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] designated October 25, 2009, as the date for the first round of voting. Within a week, President Yushchenko filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court against Verkhovna Rada's October 25 date. The President's appeal argued that his inauguration on January 23, 2005, was the commencement of his five-year term of office and as such the next presidential election must be set for the last Sunday before January 23, 2010, in accordance with Article 103.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-310155.html Yushchenko appeals parliament's decision to call presidential election for Oct. 25], [[UNIAN]] (April 8, 2009)</ref>

[[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] said on September 21, 2009, that he believes that the lists of voters at this Presidential election will be more qualitative and more "clear" than it was at [[Ukrainian Presidential election|previous elections]] because "double names" were removed from the list.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-337162.html All doubles are eliminated – Lutsenko], [[UNIAN]] (September 21, 2009)</ref> The same day the [[Party of Regions]] complained about a lot of mistakes in that list and that the number of voters fell in the Southern Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine and increased by 0.5–1% in Western Ukraine.<ref name=List>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/20606/ Regions Party worried about numerous inaccuracies in state register of voters], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (September 21, 2009)</ref> It is the first time the state register of voters will be used in a Ukrainian election.<ref name=List/>

Voting analysis showed that during the election creases started to emerge across the traditional geographical voters patterns.

According to the Director of the Penta Center for Political Studies Volodymyr Fesenko there were only small differences in the election programs of the various candidates.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53400/ Experts: Presidential campaign characterized by poor programs of candidates], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 23, 2009)</ref>

===Fraud suspicions and accusations===
According to all international organizations observing the election, allegations of electoral fraud in relation to the first round ballot were unfounded, they declared that the conduct of the elections was within internationally recognized democratic standards and a testament to the will of the people of Ukraine.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/?aid=29431 EU endorses Ukraine election result], [[euobserver]] (February 8, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/08/AR2010020803583.html International observers say Ukrainian election was free and fair], [[Washington Post]] (February 9, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/59077/ European Parliament president greets Ukraine on conducting free and fair presidential election], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 9, 2010)</ref>

A December 2009 poll found that 82 percent of Ukrainians expected vote rigging, those fears were shared by some election observers, both international and domestic. The latter also fearing the lack of an independent exit poll; which they see as essential to deterring vote fraud.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/54838/ Election watchers worried by lack of independent exit poll; survey essential to deterring vote fraud], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 11, 2009)</ref>

Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine's Prime-minister and one of the main candidates who sought election in the poll stated that: "We will not challenge any election returns to avoid tremors, which may bring about instability in this country. If the people elect their president, and this is not Yulia Tymoshenko, I will take this choice easy, for sure"<ref>[http://forua.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/tymoshenko-will-not-protest-presidential-election-outcome/ Tymoshenko will not protest presidential election outcome], [[ForUm]] (September 25, 2009)</ref>

Former President Leonid Kuchma also excluded the possibility of a third round ballot. According to Kuchma, "during the election campaign in 2004 the decision about holding the third round was political and it will not be repeated. The 2004 decision was an exclusion from a rule".<ref>[http://nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&listid=100472 Ex-president excludes third round of presidential elections], [[National Radio Ukraine]] (September 25, 2009)</ref>

Viktor Baloha, former presidential secretary under Viktor Yushchenko stated:

:"Alarming declarations about the likely vote rigging directly point to organizational weaknesses of some candidates as the law allows for reliable barriers against any electoral fraud. For instance, any presidential candidate can send his two representatives to sit on local and regional electoral commissions, appoint observers to keep an eye on voting and counting of ballots. Proxies of candidates who have wide authority can also supervise the course of the voting". "There are more than enough supervisory tools. Other effective barriers to electoral fraud are the Central Election Commission [whose members are appointed by major parliamentary parties on a quota principle] and numerous international observers. Mass media and NGOs, notably, the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, will also be effective in helping to curb fraud. Of great importance for establishing the final tally are also exit polls run by respected polling companies.they will all be used during the campaign." adding that "All the more so that there are 18 presidential candidates, some having considerable weight. That is why any declarations about the likely fraud are just attempts to justify a defeat of those who make them. Note that those candidates who are selling themselves as strong-willed and tough are most given to such declarations. In fact, such declarations expose them as would-be losers and outsiders"<ref>[http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2009/11/24/205864 Wolf-crying about likely vote rigging presidential candidates try to justify their future defeat], [[ZIK]] (November 24, 2009)</ref>

A joint poll conducted by Democratic Initiatives and Ukrainian Sociology Service of January 2010 showed that less than 5% of the polled believed that the presidential election would be fair with 41.4% of respondents that believed that the election results could be manipulated and 15.7% being certain that the entire vote would be rigged.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/56820/ Poll: Less than 5% Ukrainians believe presidential election will be fair], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 12, 2010)</ref> According to the same poll 5.8% of those polled stated they were ready to sell their votes if the sum suited them and 1.9% of the respondents were ready to sell their votes for any presidential candidates and for any funds.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/56815/ Poll: Most Ukrainians not planning to sell their votes in presidential election], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 12, 2010)</ref>
